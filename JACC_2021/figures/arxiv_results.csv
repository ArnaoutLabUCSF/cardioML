Deep Reflectance Volumes is a novel volumetric scene representation consisting
of opacity, surface normal and reflectance voxel grids. We present a novel
physically-based differentiable volume ray marching framework to render these
scene volumes under arbitrary viewpoint and lighting. This allows us to
optimize the scene volumes to minimize the error between their rendered images
and the captured images. Our method is able to reconstruct real scenes with
challenging non-Lambertian reflectance and complex geometry with occlusions and
shadowing. Moreover, it accurately generalizes to novel viewpoints and

of images, reaching human-level performances on challenging benchmarks. Yet,
the semantic analysis of videos remains challenging due to the significantly
higher dimensionality of the input data, respectively, the significantly higher
need for annotated training examples. By studying the automatic recognition of
German sign language videos, we demonstrate that on the relatively scarce
training data of 2.800 videos, modern deep learning architectures for video
analysis (such as ResNeXt) along with transfer learning on large gesture
recognition tasks, can achieve about 75% character accuracy. Considering that
this leaves us with a probability of under 25% that a 5 letter word is spelled
correctly, spell-correction systems are crucial for producing readable outputs.
The contribution of this paper is to propose a convolutional neural network for
spell-correction that expects the softmax outputs of the character recognition
network (instead of a misspelled word) as an input. We demonstrate that purely
learning on softmax inputs in combination with scarce training data yields
overfitting as the network learns the inputs by heart. In contrast, training
the network on several variants of the logits of the classification output i.e.
scaling by a constant factor, adding of random noise, mixing of softmax and
hardmax inputs or purely training on hardmax inputs, leads to better
generalization while benefitting from the significant information hidden in

intensity-based similarity measures as the loss function, where dense
correspondence between a pair of moving and fixed images is optimized through
backpropagation during training. However, intensity-based metrics can be
misleading when the assumption of intensity class correspondence is violated,
especially in cross-modality or contrast-enhanced images. Moreover, existing
learning-based registration methods are predominantly applicable to pairwise
registration and are rarely extended to groupwise registration or simultaneous
registration with multiple images. In this paper, we propose a new image

of implementing groupwise registration. We highlight the versatility of the

medical image classification tasks, but often deep models lack
interpretability. The ability of these models to explain their decisions is
important for fostering clinical trust and facilitating clinical translation.
Furthermore, for many problems in medicine there is a wealth of existing
clinical knowledge to draw upon, which may be useful in generating
explanations, but it is not obvious how this knowledge can be encoded into DL
models - most models are learnt either from scratch or using transfer learning
from a different domain. In this paper we address both of these issues. We
propose a novel DL framework for image-based classification based on a
variational autoencoder (VAE). The framework allows prediction of the output of
interest from the latent space of the autoencoder, as well as visualisation (in
the image domain) of the effects of crossing the decision boundary, thus
enhancing the interpretability of the classifier. Our key contribution is that
the VAE disentangles the latent space based on `explanations' drawn from
existing clinical knowledge. The framework can predict outputs as well as
explanations for these outputs, and also raises the possibility of discovering
new biomarkers that are separate (or disentangled) from the existing knowledge.
We demonstrate our framework on the problem of predicting response of patients
with cardiomyopathy to cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) from cine
cardiac magnetic resonance images. The sensitivity and specificity of the
proposed model on the task of CRT response prediction are 88.43% and 84.39%

understanding of the factors contributing to CRT response.",Downloaded successfully,/Volumes/Seagate_8TB/rxiv_072020/arxiv.org/2006.13811v2.pdf,Esther Puyol-Antón; Chen Chen; James R.

cardiac diseases thanks to its ability to present cardiovascular features in
excellent contrast. As compared to computed tomography (CT), MRI, however,
requires a long scan time, which inevitably induces motion artifacts and causes
patients' discomfort. Thus, there has been a strong clinical motivation to
develop techniques to reduce both the scan time and motion artifacts. Given its
successful applications in other medical imaging tasks such as MRI
super-resolution and CT metal artifact reduction, deep learning is a promising
approach for cardiac MRI motion artifact reduction. In this paper, we propose a
recurrent neural network to simultaneously extract both spatial and temporal
features from under-sampled, motion-blurred cine cardiac images for improved
image quality. The experimental results demonstrate substantially improved
image quality on two clinical test datasets. Also, our method enables
data-driven frame interpolation at an enhanced temporal resolution. Compared

step in multiple applications ranging from surveillance to heart-rate
estimation from remote-photoplethysmography. However, the existing literature
considers the problem only in the visible-range of the EM-spectrum which limits
their utility in low or no light settings where the criticality of the
application is higher. To alleviate this problem, we consider the problem of
skin segmentation from the Near-infrared images. However, Deep learning based
state-of-the-art segmentation techniques demands large amounts of labelled data
that is unavailable for the current problem. Therefore we cast the skin
segmentation problem as that of target-independent Unsupervised Domain
Adaptation (UDA) where we use the data from the Red-channel of the
visible-range to develop skin segmentation algorithm on NIR images. We propose
a method for target-independent segmentation where the 'nearest-clone' of a
target image in the source domain is searched and used as a proxy in the
segmentation network trained only on the source domain. We prove the existence
of 'nearest-clone' and propose a method to find it through an optimization
algorithm over the latent space of a Deep generative model based on variational
inference. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method for NIR skin
segmentation over the state-of-the-art UDA segmentation methods on the two
newly created skin segmentation datasets in NIR domain despite not having

this end, we investigate a deep-learning framework with novel training schemes
for classification of different thoracic pathology labels from chest x-rays. We
use the currently largest publicly available annotated dataset ChestX-ray14 of
112,120 chest radiographs of 30,805 patients. Each image was annotated with
either a 'NoFinding' class, or one or more of 14 thoracic pathology labels.
Subjects can have multiple pathologies, resulting in a multi-class, multi-label

with momentum and with restarts using cosine annealing, (2) Variable image
sizes for fine-tuning to prevent overfitting. Additionally, we use a heuristic
algorithm to select a good learning rate. Learning with restarts was used to
avoid local minima. Area Under receiver operating characteristics Curve (AUC)

regularisation on the solution space. In contrast to most of the current
approaches which impose explicit regularisation terms such as smoothness, in
this paper we propose a novel method that can implicitly learn

application-specific prior knowledge into deep learning based registration.
Particularly, the proposed biomechanics-informed regularisation leverages a
variational autoencoder (VAE) to learn a manifold for biomechanically plausible
deformations and to implicitly capture their underlying properties via
reconstructing biomechanical simulations. The learnt VAE regulariser then can
be coupled with any deep learning based registration network to regularise the
solution space to be biomechanically plausible. The proposed method is
validated in the context of myocardial motion tracking on 2D stacks of cardiac
MRI data from two different datasets. The results show that it can achieve
better performance against other competing methods in terms of motion tracking

cardiac signals from facial videos. High-quality rPPG pulse signals are
urgently demanded in many fields, such as health monitoring and emotion
recognition. However, most of the existing rPPG methods can only be used to get
average heart rate (HR) values due to the limitation of inaccurate pulse
signals. In this paper, a new framework based on generative adversarial
network, called PulseGAN, is introduced to generate realistic rPPG pulse
signals through denoising the chrominance signals. Considering that the cardiac
signal is quasi-periodic and has apparent time-frequency characteristics, the
error losses defined in time and spectrum domains are both employed with the
adversarial loss to enforce the model generating accurate pulse waveforms as
its reference. The proposed framework is tested on the public UBFC-RPPG
database in both within-database and cross-database configurations. The results
show that the PulseGAN framework can effectively improve the waveform quality,
thereby enhancing the accuracy of HR, the heart rate variability (HRV) and the
interbeat interval (IBI). The proposed method achieves the best performance

artery calcification and is a strong predictor of heart attack. Current
calcified plaque detection models show poor generalizability to different

shown how cross domain object detection can be improved using an image
translation model which translates between domains using a single shared latent
space. However, while current image translation models do a good job preserving
global/intermediate level structures they often have trouble preserving tiny
structures. In medical imaging applications, preserving small structures is
important since these structures can carry information which is highly relevant
for disease diagnosis. Recent works on image reconstruction show that complex
real-world images are better reconstructed using a union of subspaces approach.
Since small image patches are used to train the image translation model, it
makes sense to enforce that each patch be represented by a linear combination
of subspaces which may correspond to the different parts of the body present in
that patch. Motivated by this, we propose an image translation network using a
shared union of subspaces constraint and show our approach preserves subtle

expressive models such as deep kernel learning, which is an extension of sparse

aiming to protect user data privacy without revealing raw input data to a
server. It collaboratively runs a deep neural network model where the model is
split into two parts, one for the client and the other for the server.
Therefore, the server has no direct access to raw data processed at the client.
Until now, the split learning is believed to be a promising approach to protect
the client's raw data; for example, the client's data was protected in
healthcare image applications using 2D convolutional neural network (CNN)
models. However, it is still unclear whether the split learning can be applied
to other deep learning models, in particular, 1D CNN.
  In this paper, we examine whether split learning can be used to perform
privacy-preserving training for 1D CNN models. To answer this, we first design
and implement an 1D CNN model under split learning and validate its efficacy in
detecting heart abnormalities using medical ECG data. We observed that the 1D
CNN model under split learning can achieve the same accuracy of 98.9\% like the
original (non-split) model. However, our evaluation demonstrates that split
learning may fail to protect the raw data privacy on 1D CNN models. To address
the observed privacy leakage in split learning, we adopt two privacy leakage
mitigation techniques: 1) adding more hidden layers to the client side and 2)
applying differential privacy. Although those mitigation techniques are helpful
in reducing privacy leakage, they have a significant impact on model accuracy.
Hence, based on those results, we conclude that split learning alone would not

with the growing body of knowledge to compute and model the health state of an
individual continually. This dissertation presents an approach to build a
personal model and dynamically estimate the health state of an individual by
fusing multi-modal data and domain knowledge. The system is stitched together
from four essential abstraction elements: 1. the events in our life, 2. the
layers of our biological systems (from molecular to an organism), 3. the
functional utilities that arise from biological underpinnings, and 4. how we
interact with these utilities in the reality of daily life. Connecting these
four elements via graph network blocks forms the backbone by which we
instantiate a digital twin of an individual. Edges and nodes in this graph

an important task to improve patient management and clinical outcomes, as it
can help to decide whether invasive investigation and treatment are necessary.
In this work, we present three machine learning approaches capable of
performing this task. The first approach is based on radiomics, where a plaque
segmentation is used to calculate various shape-, intensity- and texture-based
features under different image transformations. A second approach is based on
deep learning and relies on centerline extraction as sole prerequisite. In the
third approach, we fuse the deep learning approach with radiomic features. On
our data the methods reached similar scores as simulated fractional flow
reserve (FFR) measurements, which - in contrast to our methods - requires an
exact segmentation of the whole coronary tree and often time-consuming manual
interaction. In literature, the performance of simulated FFR reaches an AUC
between 0.79-0.93 predicting an abnormal invasive FFR that demands
revascularization. The radiomics approach achieves an AUC of 0.86, the deep
learning approach 0.84 and the combined method 0.88 for predicting the
revascularization decision directly. While all three proposed methods can be
determined within seconds, the FFR simulation typically takes several minutes.

recently developed joint artefact detection and reconstruction method, which
reconstructs high quality MR images from k-space using a joint loss function

for automatic segmentation of radiosensitive organs from 3D tomographic CT

Methods: A deep convolutional neural network (CNN) for organ segmentation is
trained to automatically delineate radiosensitive organs from CT. With a
GPU-based Monte Carlo dose engine (ARCHER) to derive CT dose of a phantom made
from a subject's CT scan, we are then able to compute the patient-specific CT
dose for each of the segmented organs. The developed tool is validated by using
Relative Dose Error (RDE) against the organ doses calculated by ARCHER with
manual segmentation performed by radiologists. The dose computation results are
also compared against organ doses from population-average phantoms to
demonstrate the improvement achieved by using the developed tool. In this
study, two datasets were used: The Lung CT Segmentation Challenge 2017 (LCTSC)

golden-angle radial cine cardiac MRI by applying a modified version of the

extracted from the image sequences. We compare our approach to two $2D$ and a
$3D$ Deep Learning-based post processing methods and to three iterative
reconstruction methods for dynamic cardiac MRI. Our method outperforms the $2D$
spatially trained U-net and the $2D$ spatio-temporal U-net. Compared to the
$3D$ spatio-temporal U-net, our method delivers comparable results, but with
shorter training times and less training data. Compared to the Compressed
Sensing-based methods $kt$-FOCUSS and a total variation regularised
reconstruction approach, our method improves image quality with respect to all
reported metrics. Further, it achieves competitive results when compared to an
iterative reconstruction method based on adaptive regularization with
Dictionary Learning and total variation, while only requiring a small fraction
of the computational time. A persistent homology analysis demonstrates that the
data manifold of the spatio-temporal domain has a lower complexity than the
spatial domain and therefore, the learning of a projection-like mapping is
facilitated. Even when trained on only one single subject without
data-augmentation, our approach yields results which are similar to the ones
obtained on a large training dataset. This makes the method particularly
suitable for training a network on limited training data. Finally, in contrast
to the spatial $2D$ U-net, our proposed method is shown to be naturally robust

required to track blood vessel changes occurring with many pathologies
including retinopathy and cardiovascular pathologies. One of the clinical
measures that quantifies vessel changes is the arterio-venous ratio (AVR) which
represents the ratio between artery and vein diameters. This measure
significantly depends on the accuracy of vessel segmentation and classification
into arteries and veins. This paper proposes a fast, novel method for semantic
A/V segmentation combining deep learning and graph propagation.
  Methods A convolutional neural network (CNN) is proposed to jointly segment
and classify vessels into arteries and veins. The initial CNN labeling is
propagated through a graph representation of the retinal vasculature, whose
nodes are defined as the vessel branches and edges are weighted by the cost of
linking pairs of branches. To efficiently propagate the labels, the graph is
simplified into its minimum spanning tree.
  Results The method achieves an accuracy of 94.8% for vessels segmentation.
The A/V classification achieves a specificity of 92.9% with a sensitivity of
93.7% on the CT-DRIVE database compared to the state-of-the-art-specificity and
sensitivity, both of 91.7%.
  Conclusion The results show that our method outperforms the leading previous
works on a public dataset for A/V classification and is by far the fastest.

machine learning solution to signal reconstruction as well as an analysis of
optimal torso electrode positioning for prediction involving different areas of
the heart. The dataset contains simultaneous measurements from a large number
of body surface potential (BSP) and heart surface potential (HSP) electrodes,
as well as their geometric locations, recorded from an experiment using a human
model. Initially, Time Delayed Neural Nets were trained and tested across all
BSP to HSP relationships resulting in a slight trend of increased
reconstruction correlation with decreased separation of electrodes. However,
the TDNNs had overfitted to the data and failed to predict alternate heartbeat
pacings. Feed Forward Neural Nets (FFNNs) were tested in a many BSP to many HSP
prediction method. Again overfitting occurred. To reduce overfitting, the
number of training signals was reduced by analysing the optimal training BSPs
for each HSP when using basic perceptrons. This analysis involved repeat
sampling and ranking of different BSP combinations, initially, using a Monte
Carlo approximation, until being replaced with a meta-heuristic which increased
the yield of successful BSP combinations. Successful reconstructions across
heartbeat pacings were produced using these optimal BSP combinations for 80 of
the 108 HSPs, and future work exists for the testing of this method of
prediction using real patient data.",Downloaded successfully,/Volumes/Seagate_8TB/rxiv_072020/arxiv.org/1901.09831v2.pdf,Joe Horvath; Lu Shien; Tommy Peng; Avinash Malik; Mark Trew; Laura Bear,,Joe Horvath,,Laura Bear,,

343,328 HF admissions (67% of total admissions), we trained and tested our

combined with conditional random fields (CRF) model (RNNCRF) achieved the best

  Methods: The general framework consists of one CNN for detecting the LV, and
another for tissue classification. Also, three new deep learning architectures

sparsity and depthwise separable convolution into the U-net architecture, as
well as, a residual learning strategy level-to-level. To this end, we extend
the classical U-net architecture and use the generalized Jaccard distance as
optimization objective function.
  Results: The CNNs were trained and evaluated with 140 patients from two

arrhythmias, particularly atrial fibrillation, are a major global healthcare

initiating or perpetuating the arrhythmia. Ablation targets are either
anatomically defined, or identified based on their functional properties as

ECG records with apnea or hypopnea events were used with a series of deep

(FCN) that learns segmentation and landmark localisation tasks simultaneously.
The architecture of the proposed FCN uses a 2.5D representation, thus combining
the computational advantage of 2D FCNs networks and the capability of
addressing 3D spatial consistency without compromising segmentation accuracy.
Moreover, the refinement step is designed to explicitly enforce a shape
constraint and improve segmentation quality. This step is effective for
overcoming image artefacts (e.g. due to different breath-hold positions and
large slice thickness), which preclude the creation of anatomically meaningful
3D cardiac shapes. The proposed pipeline is fully automated, due to network's
ability to infer landmarks, which are then used downstream in the pipeline to
initialise atlas propagation. We validate the pipeline on 1831 healthy subjects

differences in the underlying heart structure in two phases, the images in the

enabled real-time performance with human-level accuracy. However, occasionally
even the best method fails due to low image quality, artifacts or unexpected
behaviour of black box algorithms. Being able to predict segmentation quality
in the absence of ground truth is of paramount importance in clinical practice,
but also in large-scale studies to avoid the inclusion of invalid data in
subsequent analysis.
  In this work, we propose two approaches of real-time automated quality
control for cardiovascular MR segmentations using deep learning. First, we
train a neural network on 12,880 samples to predict Dice Similarity
Coefficients (DSC) on a per-case basis. We report a mean average error (MAE) of
0.03 on 1,610 test samples and 97% binary classification accuracy for
separating low and high quality segmentations. Secondly, in the scenario where
no manually annotated data is available, we train a network to predict DSC
scores from estimated quality obtained via a reverse testing strategy. We
report an MAE=0.14 and 91% binary classification accuracy for this case.
Predictions are obtained in real-time which, when combined with real-time
segmentation methods, enables instant feedback on whether an acquired scan is
analysable while the patient is still in the scanner. This further enables new

Compressed Sensing (CS).
  METHODS: A 3D (2D plus time) CNN architecture was developed, and trained
using 2276 gold-standard paired 3D data sets, with 14x radial undersampling.
Four sampling schemes were tested, using 169 previously unseen 3D 'synthetic'

acquired in 10 new patients (122 3D data sets), and reconstructed using the 3D

  RESULTS: Sampling pattern was shown to be important for image quality, and
accurate visualisation of cardiac structures. For actual real-time data,

shown to be more than 5x faster than GRASP. Additionally, CNN image quality and

robust method for detecting PHMs in social media, which we call WESPAD, that
combines lexical, syntactic, word embedding-based, and context-based features.
WESPAD is able to generalize from few examples by automatically distorting the
word embedding space to most effectively detect the true health mentions.
Unlike previously proposed state-of-the-art supervised and deep-learning
techniques, WESPAD requires relatively little training data, which makes it
possible to adapt, with minimal effort, to each new disease and condition. We
evaluate WESPAD on both an established publicly available Flu detection
benchmark, and on a new dataset that we have constructed with mentions of
multiple health conditions. Our experiments show that WESPAD outperforms the
baselines and state-of-the-art methods, especially in cases when the number and

  Approach: A morphological and rhythm description of the cardiac behavior is
obtained by a knowledge-based interpretation of the signal using the
\textit{Construe} abductive framework. Then, a set of meaningful features are
extracted for each individual heartbeat and as a summary of the full record.
The feature distributions were used to elucidate the expert criteria underlying
the labeling of the 2017 Physionet/CinC Challenge dataset, enabling a manual

interpretation limits high throughput analysis, limiting echocardiography from
reaching its full clinical and research potential for precision medicine. Deep
learning is a cutting-edge machine-learning technique that has been useful in
analyzing medical images but has not yet been widely applied to
echocardiography, partly due to the complexity of echocardiograms' multi view,
multi modality format. The essential first step toward comprehensive computer
assisted echocardiographic interpretation is determining whether computers can
learn to recognize standard views. To this end, we anonymized 834,267
transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) images from 267 patients (20 to 96 years, 51
percent female, 26 percent obese) seen between 2000 and 2017 and labeled them
according to standard views. Images covered a range of real world clinical
variation. We built a multilayer convolutional neural network and used
supervised learning to simultaneously classify 15 standard views. Eighty
percent of data used was randomly chosen for training and 20 percent reserved
for validation and testing on never seen echocardiograms. Using multiple images
from each clip, the model classified among 12 video views with 97.8 percent
overall test accuracy without overfitting. Even on single low resolution
images, test accuracy among 15 views was 91.7 percent versus 70.2 to 83.5
percent for board-certified echocardiographers. Confusional matrices, occlusion
experiments, and saliency mapping showed that the model finds recognizable
similarities among related views and classifies using clinically relevant image

such as end-systolic volume (ESV), end-diastolic volume (EDV), ejection
fraction (EF), stroke volume (SV), and ventricular mass (VM) are clinically
well established. Image segmentation can be challenging and time-consuming, due
to the complex anatomy of the human heart.
  Objectives: This study introduces $\nu$-net (/nju:n$\varepsilon$t/) -- a deep
learning approach allowing for fully-automated high quality segmentation of
right (RV) and left ventricular (LV) endocardium and epicardium for extraction
of cardiac function parameters.
  Methods: A set consisting of 253 manually segmented cases has been used to
train a deep neural network. Subsequently, the network has been evaluated on 4
different multicenter data sets with a total of over 1000 cases.
  Results: For LV EF the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) is 98, 95,
and 80 % (95 %), and for RV EF 96, and 87 % (80 %) on the respective data sets
(human expert ICCs reported in parenthesis). The LV VM ICC is 95, and 94 % (84

philosophies. $\nu$-net exhibits state of-the-art performance in terms of dice

  Conclusions: Biventricular mass and function parameters can be determined
reliably in high quality by applying a deep neural network for cardiac MRI

predicting heart failure using an order of magnitude less training data.

algorithm that provides timely and granular assessments for the clinical acuity
of ward patients based on their (temporal) lab tests and vital signs; the
proposed risk scoring system ensures timely intensive care unit (ICU)
admissions for clinically deteriorating patients. Methods: The risk scoring
system learns a set of latent patient subtypes from the offline electronic
health record data, and trains a mixture of Gaussian Process (GP) experts,
where each expert models the physiological data streams associated with a
specific patient subtype. Transfer learning techniques are used to learn the
relationship between a patient's latent subtype and her static admission
information (e.g. age, gender, transfer status, ICD-9 codes, etc). Results:
Experiments conducted on data from a heterogeneous cohort of 6,321 patients
admitted to Ronald Reagan UCLA medical center show that our risk score
significantly and consistently outperforms the currently deployed risk scores,
such as the Rothman index, MEWS, APACHE and SOFA scores, in terms of
timeliness, true positive rate (TPR), and positive predictive value (PPV).
Conclusion: Our results reflect the importance of adopting the concepts of
personalized medicine in critical care settings; significant accuracy and

step towards application of multi-physics computational models in clinical
practice. Designing robust personalization algorithms is often a tedious,
time-consuming, model- and data-specific process. We propose to use artificial
intelligence concepts to learn this task, inspired by how human experts
manually perform it. The problem is reformulated in terms of reinforcement
learning. In an off-line phase, Vito, our self-taught artificial agent, learns
a representative decision process model through exploration of the
computational model: it learns how the model behaves under change of

personalization. The algorithm is model-independent; applying it to a new model
requires only adjusting few hyper-parameters of the agent and defining the
observations to match. The full knowledge of the model itself is not required.
Vito was tested in a synthetic scenario, showing that it could learn how to
optimize cost functions generically. Then Vito was applied to the inverse
problem of cardiac electrophysiology and the personalization of a whole-body
circulation model. The obtained results suggested that Vito could achieve
equivalent, if not better goodness of fit than standard methods, while being
more robust (up to 11% higher success rates) and with faster (up to seven

These methods have the advantage that used classification features are trained

The method is based on hierarchical coarse-to-fine classification of local
image regions (superpixels). Superpixels are extracted from the abdominal
region using Simple Linear Iterative Clustering (SLIC). An initial probability
response map is generated, using patch-level confidences and a two-level
cascade of random forest classifiers, from which superpixel regions with
probabilities larger 0.5 are retained. These retained superpixels serve as a
highly sensitive initial input of the pancreas and its surroundings to a
ConvNet that samples a bounding box around each superpixel at different scales
(and random non-rigid deformations at training time) in order to assign a more
distinct probability of each superpixel region being pancreas or not. We
evaluate our method on CT images of 82 patients (60 for training, 2 for

heuristics designed by experts, $e.g.$, distinct shapes of ""folded"" lightcurves

of flat white noise. Therefore, every data stream has an anti-stream: data
generated by the inverse model. Similarity between two streams, then, is the
degree to which one, when summed to the other's anti-stream, mutually
annihilates all statistical structure to noise. We call this data smashing. We
present diverse applications, including disambiguation of brainwaves pertaining

in the context of the Fuzzy Inductive Reasoning (FIR) methodology. FIR emerged
from the General Systems Problem Solving developed by G. Klir. It is a data
driven methodology based on systems behavior rather than on structural
knowledge. It is a very useful tool for both the modeling and the prediction of
those systems for which no previous structural knowledge is available. FIR
reasoning is based on pattern rules synthesized from the available data. The
size of the pattern rule base can be very large making the prediction process
quite difficult. In order to reduce the size of the pattern rule base, it is
possible to automatically extract classical Sugeno fuzzy rules starting from
the set of pattern rules. The Sugeno rule base preserves pattern rules
knowledge as much as possible. In this process some information is lost but
robustness is considerably increased. In the forecasting process either the
pattern rule base or the Sugeno fuzzy rule base can be used. The first option
is desirable when the computational resources make it possible to deal with the
overall pattern rule base or when the extracted fuzzy rules are not accurate
enough due to uncertainty associated to the original data. In the second
option, the prediction process is done by means of the classical Sugeno
inference system. If the amount of uncertainty associated to the data is small,
the predictions obtained using the Sugeno fuzzy rule base will be very
accurate. In this paper a mixed pattern/fuzzy rules strategy is proposed to
deal with uncertainty in such a way that the best of both perspectives is used.
Areas in the data space with a higher level of uncertainty are identified by
means of the so-called error models. The prediction process in these areas
makes use of a mixed pattern/fuzzy rules scheme, whereas areas identified with
a lower level of uncertainty only use the Sugeno fuzzy rule base. The proposed

Currently, our knowledge of the mechanisms of COVID-19 disease pathogenesis is very limited which has hampered attempts to develop targeted antiviral strategies. Therefore, we urgently need an effective therapy for this unmet medical need. Viruses hijack and dysregulate cellular machineries in order for them to replicate and infect more cells. Thus, identifying and targeting dysregulated signaling pathways that have been taken over by viruses is one strategy for developing an effective antiviral therapy. We have developed a high-throughput drug screening system to identify potential antiviral drugs targeting SARS-CoV-2. We utilized a small molecule library of 430 protein kinase inhibitors, which are in various stages of clinical trials. Most of the tested kinase antagonists are ATP competitive inhibitors, a class of nucleoside analogs, which have been shown to have potent antiviral activity. From the primary screen, we have identified 34 compounds capable of inhibiting viral cytopathic effect in epithelial cells. Network of drug and protein relations showed that these compounds specifically targeted a limited number of cellular kinases. More importantly, we have identified mTOR-PI3K-AKT, ABL-BCR/MAPK, and DNA-Damage Response (DDR) pathways as key cellular signaling pathways critical for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Subsequently, a secondary screen confirmed compounds such as Berzosertib (VE-822), Vistusertib (AZD2014), and Nilotinib with anti SARS-CoV-2 activity. Finally, we found that Berzosertib, an ATR kinase inhibitor in the DDR pathway, demonstrated potent antiviral activity in a human epithelial cell line and human induced pluripotent stem cell (hIPSC)-derived cardiomyocytes. These inhibitors are already in clinical trials of phase 2 or 3 for cancer treatment, and can be repurposed as promising drug candidates for a host-directed therapy of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In conclusion, we have identified small molecule inhibitors exhibiting anti SARS-CoV-2 activity by blocking key cellular kinases, which gives insight on important mechanism of host-pathogen interaction. These compounds can be further evaluated for the treatment of COVID-19 patients following additional in vivo safety and efficacy studies.",Downloaded successfully,/Volumes/Seagate_8TB/rxiv_072020/biorxiv.org/2020.06.24.150326v1.pdf,Gustavo Garcia Jr.; Arun Sharma; Arunachalam Ramaiah; Chandani Sen; Donald Kohn; Brigitte Gomperts; Clive N.

EECs can communicate nutritional information to the nervous system, but similar mechanisms for microbial information are unknown. Using in vivo real-time measurements of EEC and nervous system activity in zebrafish, we discovered that the bacteria Edwardsiella tarda specifically activates EECs through the receptor transient receptor potential ankyrin A1 (Trpa1) and increases intestinal motility in an EEC-dependent manner. Microbial, pharmacological, or optogenetic activation of Trpa1+EECs directly stimulates vagal sensory ganglia and activates cholinergic enteric neurons through 5-HT. We identified a distinct subset of indole derivatives of tryptophan catabolites produced by E. tarda that potently activate zebrafish EEC Trpa1 signaling and also directly activate human and mouse Trpa1.

Tissue EVs may thus lend insights into disease mechanisms and also betray disease when released into easily accessed biological fluids. Since brain-derived EVs (bdEVs) and their cargo may serve as biomarkers of neurodegenerative diseases, we evaluated modifications to a published, rigorous protocol for separation of EVs from brain tissue and studied effects of processing variables on quantitative and qualitative outcomes. To this end, size exclusion chromatography (SEC) and sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation were compared as final separation steps in protocols involving stepped ultracentrifugation. bdEVs were separated from brain tissues of human, macaque, and mouse. Effects of tissue perfusion and a model of post-mortem interval (PMI) before final bdEV separation were probed. MISEV2018-compliant EV characterization was performed, and both small RNA and protein profiling were done. We conclude that the modified, SEC-employing protocol achieves EV separation efficiency roughly similar to a protocol using gradient density ultracentrifugation, while decreasing operator time and, potentially, variability. The protocol appears to yield bdEVs of higher purity for human tissues compared with those of macaque and, especially, mouse, suggesting opportunities for optimization. Where possible, perfusion should be performed in animal models. The interval between death/tissue storage/processing and final bdEV separation can also affect bdEV populations and composition and should thus be recorded for rigorous reporting. Finally, different populations of EVs obtained through the modified method reported herein display characteristic RNA and protein content that hint at biomarker potential. To conclude, this study finds that the automatable and increasingly employed technique of SEC can be applied to tissue EV separation, and also reveals more about the importance of species-specific and technical considerations when working with tissue EVs.

Vaccination of mice with recombinant HSP25 (rHSP25, murine ortholog of human rHSP27) increased AAb levels, attenuated atherogenesis and reduced plaque inflammation and cholesterol content. We sought to determine if the HSP27 immune complex (IC) altered MΦ inflammation signaling (Toll Like Receptor 4; TLR4), and scavenger receptors involved in cholesterol uptake (SR-AI, CD-36). Combining a validated polyclonal IgG anti-HSP27 antibody (PAb) with rHSP27 enhanced binding to THP-1 MΦ cell membranes and activation of NF-κB signaling via TLR4, competing away LPS and effecting an anti-inflammatory cytokine profile. Similarly, adding the PAb with rHSP27 enhanced binding to SR-AI and CD-36, as well as lowered oxLDL binding in HEK293 cells separately transfected with SR-AI and CD-36, or THP-1 MΦ. Finally, the PAb enhanced the uptake and internalization of rHSP27 in THP-1 MΦ. Thus, the HSP27 IC potentiates HSP27 cell membrane signaling with receptors involved in modulating inflammation and cholesterol uptake, as well as HSP27 internalization.

In this study, we identified an active form of AMPK localized at the intercalated discs in the heart, a specific cell-cell junction present between cardiomyocytes. A contractile inhibitor, MYK-461, prevented the localization of AMPK at the intercalated discs, and the effect was reversed by the removal of MYK-461, suggesting that the localization of AMPK is regulated by mechanical stress. Time-lapse imaging analysis revealed that the inhibition of CLIP-170 Ser-311 phosphorylation by AMPK leads to the accumulation of MTs at the intercalated discs. Interestingly, MYK-461 increased the individual cell area of cardiomyocytes in CLIP-170 phosphorylation-dependent manner. Moreover, heart-specific CLIP-170 S311A transgenic mice demonstrated elongation of cardiomyocytes along with accumulated MTs, leading to progressive decline in cardiac contraction.

By combining histology, electron microscopy and high-throughout genomics, proteomics and metabolomics, we found that deletion of Hif1a leads to impaired embryonic glycolysis without influencing cardiomyocyte proliferation and results in an increased mitochondrial number, activation of a transient amino acid response and upregulation of HIF2α and ATF4 by E12.5.

While rare syndromes have been identified that predispose to aortic aneurysm, the common genetic basis for the size of the aorta remains largely unknown. By leveraging a deep learning architecture that was originally developed to recognize natural images, we trained a model to evaluate the dimensions of the ascending and descending thoracic aorta in cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. After manual annotation of just 116 samples, we applied this model to 3,840,140 images from the UK Biobank. We then conducted a genome-wide association study in 33,420 individuals, revealing 68 loci associated with ascending and 35 with descending thoracic aortic diameter, of which 10 loci overlapped. Integration of common variation with transcriptome-wide analyses, rare-variant burden tests, and single nucleus RNA sequencing prioritized SVIL, a gene highly expressed in vascular smooth muscle, that was significantly associated with the diameter of the ascending and descending aorta.

Many biotechnology laboratories are rushing to develop therapeutic antibodies and antiviral drugs for treatment of this viral disease. The viral CoV spike (S) glycoprotein is one of the main targets for pharmacological intervention. Its receptor-binding domain (RBD) interacts with the human ACE2 receptor ensuring the entry of the viral genomes into the host cell. In this work, we report on the differences in the binding of the RBD of the previous coronavirus SARS-CoV and of the newer 2019-nCoV coronavirus to the human ACE2 receptor using atomistic molecular dynamics techniques. Our results show major mutations in the 2019-nCoV RBD with respect to the SARS-CoV RBD occurring at the interface of RBD-ACE2 complex. These mutations make the 2019-nCoV RBD protein backbone much more flexible, hydrophobic interactions are reduced and additional polar/charged residues appear at the interface. We observe that higher flexibility of the 2019-nCoV RBD with respect to the SARS-CoV RBD leads to a bigger binding interface between the 2019-nCoV RBD and ACE2 and to about 20% more contacts between them in comparison with SARS-CoV. Taken together, the 2019-nCoV RBD shows more stable binding interface and higher binding affinity for the ACE2 receptor. The mutations not only stabilize the binding interface, they also lead to overall more stable 2019-nCoV RBD protein structure, even far from the binding interface.

It is well-established that coordinated and localized changes in actin and microtubule dynamics are vital for cytokinetic ring formation, as well as establishment of the abscission site. Actin cytoskeleton reorganization during abscission would not be possible without the interplay between Rab11- and Rab35-containing endosomes and their effector proteins, whose roles in regulating endocytic pathways at the cleavage furrow have now been studied extensively. Here, we identified Rab14 as novel regulator of abscission. We demonstrate that depletion of Rab14 causes either cytokinesis failure or significantly prolongs division time. We show that Rab14 regulates the efficiency of recruiting Rab11-endosomes to the central spindle microtubules and that Rab14 knockout leads to inhibition of actin clearance at the abscission site. Finally, we demonstrate that Rab14 binds to microtubule minus-end interacting MACF2/CAMSAP3 complex and that this binding is required for targeting of early endosomes to the central spindle. Collectively, our data identified Rab14/MACF2/CAMSAP3 as a protein complex that regulates Rab11-endosome targeting and the establishment of the abscission site.",Downloaded successfully,/Volumes/Seagate_8TB/rxiv_072020/biorxiv.org/2020.04.21.052449v1.pdf,Paulius Gibieža; Eric Peterman; Huxley K.

Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) causes a condition characterized by high fever, headache, rash, and joint pain. Recent investigations reveal presence of bone lesions and erosive arthritis in the joints of CHIKV infected patients, indicating an association of bone pathology with CHIKV infection. However, the molecular mechanism underlying CHIKV-induced bone pathology remains poorly defined. Bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) contribute to bone homeostasis by differentiating into osteogenic cells which later mature to form the bone. Disruption of osteogenic differentiation and function of BMSCs lead to bone pathologies. Studies show that virus infections can alter the properties and function of BMSCs. However, to date, pathogenesis of CHIKV infection in this context has not been studied. In the current study, we investigated the susceptibility of BMSCs and osteogenic cells to CHIKV and studied the effect of infection on these cells. To our knowledge, for the first time we report that CHIKV can productively infect BMSCs and osteogenic cells. We also observed a decreased gene expression of the major regulator of osteogenic differentiation, RUNX2 in CHIKV infected osteogenic cells. Furthermore, impaired functional properties of osteogenic cells i.e. decreased production and activity of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and matrix mineralization were observed in the presence of CHIKV infection. Thus, we conclude that CHIKV likely impairs osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs indicating a possible role of BMSCs in altering bone homeostasis during CHIKV infection.",Downloaded successfully,/Volumes/Seagate_8TB/rxiv_072020/biorxiv.org/2020.04.15.044065v1.pdf,Enakshi Roy; Wen Shi; Bin Duan; St Patrick Reid,,Enakshi Roy,,St Patrick Reid,,

The World’s demand for animal-derived protein has been projected to double by 2050. As a result there is a resultant increase in livestock industries to meet this demand. While meat is generally consumed as a source of protein, processed cattle hide popularly known as “Kanda” in southeastern Nigeria is consumed as a substitute for meat though it may not necessarily provide the same level of nutritional value with meat. The method of processing this food delicacy (Kanda) by singeing with scrap tyre or firewood has opened the door for heavy metal and or polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAHs) contamination, thereby putting unsuspecting consumers at health risk. This study therefore investigated the effects of consuming scrap tyre-singed cattle hide and firewood singed cattle hide on the kidney, liver and heart of male Wistar rats. Consuming singed cattle hides significantly elevated some serum marker enzymes important in kidney, liver and heart damage i.e alanine and aspartate aminotransferases, alkaline phosphatase, creatine kinase, and lactate dehydrogenase, with the groups that were fed with the hide singed with scrap tyre showing severe elevations. Consuming the singed Kanda also significantly decreased the serum concentrations of K+, Na+, Cl−, and significantly increased HCO3− and urea concentration.

Heart failure is a common comorbidity of cardiometabolic syndrome. Successful drug development to prevent cardiometabolic syndrome and associated comorbidities requires preclinical models predictive of human conditions. To characterize the heart failure component of cardiometabolic syndrome, cardiometabolic, metabolic, and renal biomarkers were evaluated in obese and lean ZSF1 20-to 22-week-old male rats. Cardiac function, exercise capacity, and left ventricular gene expression were also analyzed. Obese ZSF1 rats exhibited multiple features of human cardiometabolic syndrome by pathological changes in systemic renal, metabolic, and cardiovascular disease circulating biomarkers. Hemodynamic assessment, echocardiography, and decreased exercise capacity confirmed heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. RNA-seq results demonstrated changes in left ventricular gene expression associated with fatty acid and branched chain amino acid metabolism, cardiomyopathy, cardiac hypertrophy, and heart failure. Twelve weeks of growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) treatment significantly decreased body weight, food intake, blood glucose, and triglycerides and improved exercise capacity in obese ZSF1 males. Systemic cardiovascular injury markers were significantly lower in GDF15-treated obese ZSF1 rats.

Integration of GWAS with gene regulatory networks addresses both issues by aggregating weak genetic signals within regulatory programs. Here we develop a Bayesian framework that integrates GWAS summary statistics with regulatory networks to infer enrichments and associations simultaneously. Our method improves upon existing approaches by explicitly modeling network topology to assess enrichments, and by automatically leveraging enrichments to identify associations. Applying this method to 18 human traits and 38 regulatory networks shows that genetic signals of complex traits are often enriched in networks specific to trait-relevant tissue or cell types.

Cells withstand external forces by adjusting the stiffness of its cytoskeleton. Microtubules (MTs) act as compression-bearing elements in response to mechanical cues. Therefore, MT dynamics affect cell mechanics. Yet, how mechanical loads control MT dynamics to adjust cell mechanics to its locally constrained environment has remained unclear. Here, we show that mechanical forces rewire glutamine metabolism to promote MT glutamylation and force cell mechanics, thereby modulating mechanodependent cell functions. Pharmacologic inhibition of glutamine metabolism decreased MT glutamylation and affected their mechanical stabilization. Similarly, depletion of the tubulin glutamylase TTLL4 or overexpression of tubulin mutants lacking glutamylation site(s) increased MT dynamics, cell compliance and contractility, and thereby impacted cell spreading, proliferation and migration. Together our results indicate that mechanical cues sustain cell mechanics through glutaminolysis-dependent MT glutamylation, linking cell metabolism to MT dynamics and cell mechanics.

This approach reproducibly differentiated thirteen diverse h-iPSC lines into h-iECs with exceedingly high efficiency. In contrast, standard differentiation methods that relied on endogenous ETV2 were inefficient and notably inconsistent. Our h-iECs were functionally competent in many respects, including the ability to form perfused vascular networks in vivo.

However, these loci only explain 17-27% of the trait variance and a comprehensive understanding of the molecular mechanisms has not been achieved. In this study, we utilized an integrative genomics approach leveraging diverse genomic data from human populations to investigate whether genetic variants associated with various plasma lipid traits, namely total cholesterol (TC), high and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL and LDL), and triglycerides (TG), from GWAS were concentrated on specific parts of tissue-specific gene regulatory networks. In addition to the expected lipid metabolism pathways, gene subnetworks involved in ‘interferon signaling’, ‘autoimmune/immune activation’, ‘visual transduction’, and ‘protein catabolism’ were significantly associated with all lipid traits. Additionally, we detected trait-specific subnetworks, including cadherin-associated subnetworks for LDL, glutathione metabolism for HDL, valine, leucine and isoleucine biosynthesis for TC, and insulin signaling and complement pathways for TG. Finally, utilizing gene-gene relations revealed by tissue-specific gene regulatory networks, we detected both known (e.g. APOH, APOA4, and ABCA1) and novel (e.g. F2 in adipose tissue) key regulator genes in these lipid-associated subnetworks. Knockdown of F2 gene (Coagulation Factor II, Thrombin) in 3T3-L1 adipocytes reduced gene expression of Abcb11, Apoa5, Apof, Gc, Fabp, Hrg, Proc, and Cd36, several of which are important in lipoprotein transport and fatty acid uptake, providing evidence for a link between adipose thrombin and plasma lipid regulation.

Although mainly studied in sensory nerves, there are reports of TRPV1 expression in isolated segments of the vasculature, but whether the channel localizes to vascular endothelium or smooth muscle is controversial and the distribution and functional roles of TRPV1 in arteries remain unknown. We mapped functional TRPV1 expression throughout the mouse arterial circulation. Analysis of reporter mouse lines TRPV1PLAP-nlacZ and TRPV1-Cre:tdTomato combined with Ca2+ imaging revealed specific localization of TRPV1 to smooth muscle of terminal arterioles in the heart, fat and skeletal muscle. Capsaicin evoked inward currents and raised intracellular Ca2+ levels in arterial smooth muscle cells, constricted arterioles ex vivo and in vivo and increased systemic blood pressure in mice and rats. Further, capsaicin markedly and dose-dependently reduced coronary flow. Pharmacologic and/or genetic disruption of TRPV1 abolished all these effects of capsaicin as well as vasoconstriction triggered by lysophosphatidic acid, a bioactive lipid generated by platelets and atherogenic plaques. Notably, ablation of sensory nerves did not affect the responses to capsaicin revealing a vascular smooth muscle-restricted signaling mechanism. Moreover, unlike in sensory nerves, TRPV1 function in arteries was resistant to activity-induced desensitization. Thus, TRPV1 activation in vascular myocytes of resistance arterioles enables a persistent depolarizing current, leading to constriction of coronary, skeletal muscle, and adipose arterioles and a sustained increase in systemic blood pressure.",Downloaded successfully,/Volumes/Seagate_8TB/rxiv_072020/biorxiv.org/2020.02.04.934117v2.pdf,Thieu X.

However, small molecule inhibitors of MEIS1 remained unknown. This led us to develop inhibitors of MEIS1 that could modulate HSC activity. To this end, we have established a library of relevant homeobox family inhibitors and developed a high-throughput in silico screening strategy against homeodomain of MEIS proteins using the AutoDock Vina and PaDEL-ADV platform. We have screened over a million druggable small molecules in silico and selected putative MEIS inhibitors (MEISi) with no predicted cytotoxicity or cardiotoxicity. This was followed by in vitro validation of putative MEIS inhibitors using MEIS dependent luciferase reporter assays and analysis in the ex vivo HSC assays. We have shown that small molecules named MEISi-1 and MEISi-2 significantly inhibit MEIS-luciferase reporters in vitro and induce murine (LSKCD34low cells) and human (CD34+, CD133+, and ALDHhi cells) HSC self-renewal ex vivo. In addition, inhibition of MEIS proteins results in downregulation of Meis1 and MEIS1 target gene expression including Hif-1α, Hif-2α and HSC quiescence modulators. MEIS inhibitors are effective in vivo as evident by induced HSC content in the murine bone marrow and downregulation of expression of MEIS target genes.

We use an extension of the Generalized Linear Model framework to describe the cross-correlograms between pairs of neurons and separate correlograms into two parts: a slowly varying effect due to background fluctuations and a fast, transient effect due to the synapse. We then use the observations from all putative connections in the recording to estimate two network properties: the presynaptic neuron type (excitatory or inhibitory) and the relationship between synaptic latency and distance between neurons. Constraining the presynaptic neuron’s type, synaptic latencies, and time constants improves synapse detection. In data from simulated networks, this model outperforms two previously developed synapse detection methods, especially on the weak connections.

Therefore, biomarkers for depression and drug-response would help tailor treatment strategies. This study made use of banked human lymphoblast cell lines (LCLs) from normal and depressed subjects; the latter divided into remitters and non-remitters. Due to the fact that previous studies have shown effects on growth factors, cytokines and elements of the cAMP generating system as potential biomarkers for depression and antidepressant action, these were examined in LCLs. Initial gene and protein expression profiles for signaling cascades related to neuroendocrine and inflammatory functions differ among the three groups. Growth factor genes, including VEGFA and BDNF were significantly down-regulated in cells from depressed subjects. In addition, omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) have been reported to act as both antidepressants and anti-inflammatories, but the mechanisms for these effects are not established. Here we showed that n-3 PUFAs and escitalopram (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, SSRIs) treatment increased adenylyl cyclase (AC) and BDNF gene expression in LCLs. These data are consistent with clinical observations showing that n-3 PUFA and SSRI have antidepressant affects, which may be additive. Contrary to observations made in neuronal and glial cells, n-3 PUFA treatment attenuated cAMP accumulation in LCLs. However, while lymphoblasts show paradoxical responses to neurons and glia, patient-derived lymphoblasts appear to carry potential depression biomarkers making them an important tool for studying precision medicine in depressive patients.

While IL-33 canonically triggers type 2 cytokine responses, this cytokine can also synergize with type 1 cytokines like IL-12 to provoke interferon-gamma (IFN-γ). We show that picogram concentrations of IL-12 and IL-33 are sufficient to promote robust secretion of IFN-γ by human NK cells that greatly exceeds responses to either cytokine alone. Nanogram doses of IL-33, potentially consistent with levels in tissue microenvironments, synergize with IL-12 to induce secretion of additional cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). IL-33-induced activation of the p38 MAPK pathway in human NK cells is crucial for enhanced release of IFN-γ and TNF in response to IL-12. Mechanistically, IL-33-induced p38 MAPK signaling enhances stability of IFNG transcripts and triggers ADAM17-mediated cleavage of TNF from the cell surface.

Mitochondrial uniparental inheritance (mito-UPI) could be beneficial in that it avoids possible genetic conflicts between organelles with different genetic backgrounds, as recently shown in mice; and it could prevent the spread of selfish genetic elements in the mitochondrial genome. Despite the prevalence of observed mito-UPI, the underlying mechanisms and the genes involved in controlling this non-mendelian inheritance are poorly understood in many species. In Cryptococcus neoformans, a human pathogenic basidiomyceteous fungus, mating types (MATα and MATa) are defined by alternate alleles at the single MAT locus that evolved from fusion of the two MAT loci (P/R encoding pheromones and pheromone receptors, HD encoding homeodomain transcription factors) that are the ancestral state in the basidiomycota. Mitochondria are inherited uniparentally from the MATa parent in C. neoformans and this requires the SXI1α and SXI2a HD factors encoded by MAT. However, there is evidence additional genes contribute to control of mito-UPI in Cryptococcus. Here we show that in Cryptococcus amylolentus, a sibling species of C. neoformans with unlinked P/R and HD MAT loci, mitochondrial uniparental inheritance is controlled by the P/R locus, and is independent of the HD locus. Consistently, by replacing the MATα alleles of the pheromones (MF) and pheromone receptor (STE3) with the MATa alleles, we show that these P/R locus defining genes indeed affect mito-UPI in C. neoformans during sexual reproduction. Additionally, we show that during early stages of C. neoformans sexual reproduction, conjugation tubes are always produced by the MATα cells, resulting in unidirectional migration of the MATα nucleus into the MATa cell during zygote formation. This process is controlled by the P/R locus and could serve to physically restrict movement of MATα mitochondria in the zygotes, and thereby contribute to mito-UPI. We propose a model in which both physical and genetic mechanisms function in concert to prevent the coexistence of mitochondria from the two parents in the zygote and subsequently in the meiotic progeny, thus ensuring mito-UPI in pathogenic Cryptococcus, as well as in closely related non-pathogenic species.

Cardiac-specific overexpression of Glut1, the embryonic form of constitutively active glucose transporter, resulted in an increase in glucose uptake and concomitant glycogen storage in postnatal heart. Upon cryoinjury, Glut1 transgenic hearts showed higher regenerative capacity with less fibrosis than non-transgenic control hearts. Interestingly, flow cytometry analysis revealed two distinct populations of ventricular cardiomyocytes: Tnnt2-high and Tnnt2-low cardiomyocytes, the latter of which showed significantly higher mitotic activity in response to high intracellular glucose in Glut1 transgenic hearts.

Following neutrophil arrest, adhesion stabilization occurs as the neutrophil interacts with the endothelial surface and crawls into a favorable position for extravasation. The cytoskeletal protein vinculin has been implicated in other cell types as a regulator of adhesion strength by promoting focal adhesion maturation and as a sensor of the mechanical properties of the microenvironment. Neutrophils express vinculin but do not form mature focal adhesions. Here, we characterize the role of vinculin in β2 integrin-dependent neutrophil adhesion, motility, mechanosensing, and recruitment. We observe that knockout of vinculin attenuates, but does not completely abrogate, neutrophil adhesion, spreading, and crawling under static conditions. In the presence of forces from fluid flow, vinculin was not required for neutrophil adhesion or migration. Vinculin deficiency only mildly attenuated neutrophil traction stresses and spreading on stiff, but not soft, polyacrylamide gels indicating a minor role for vinculin in the mechanosensing of the neutrophil as compared to slower moving mesenchymal cells that form mature focal adhesions. Consistent with these findings, we observe in vivo neutrophil recruitment into the inflamed peritoneum of mice remains intact in the absence of vinculin.

The transcriptional network that coordinates CM maturation is poorly understood, creating a bottleneck for cardiac regenerative medicine. Forward genetic screens are a powerful, unbiased method to gain novel insights into transcriptional networks, yet this approach has rarely been used in vivo in mammals because of high resource demands. Here we utilized somatic mutagenesis to perform the first reported in vivo CRISPR genetic screen within a mammalian heart. We discovered and validated several novel transcriptional regulators of CM maturation. Among them were RNF20 and RNF40, which form a complex that monoubiquitinates H2B on lysine 120. Mechanistic studies indicated that this epigenetic mark controls dynamic changes in gene expression required for CM maturation.

While substantial progress has been made to define the causal somatic mutation profile for MPNs2, epidemiologic studies indicate a significant heritable component for the disease that is among the highest known for all cancers3. However, only a limited set of genetic risk loci have been identified, and the underlying biological mechanisms leading to MPN acquisition remain unexplained. Here, to define the inherited risk profile, we conducted the largest genome-wide association study of MPNs to date (978,913 individuals with 3,224 cases) and identified 14 genome-wide significant loci, as well as a polygenic signature that increases the odds for disease acquisition by nearly 3-fold between the top and median deciles. Interestingly, we find a shared genetic architecture between MPN risk and several hematopoietic traits spanning distinct lineages, as well as an association between increased MPN risk and longer leukocyte telomere length, collectively implicating HSC function and self-renewal. Strikingly, we find a significant enrichment for risk variants mapping to accessible chromatin in HSCs compared with other hematopoietic populations. Finally, gene mapping identifies modulators of HSC biology and targeted variant-to-function analyses suggest likely roles for CHEK2 and GFI1B in altering HSC function to confer disease risk. Overall, we demonstrate the power of human genetic studies to illuminate a previously unappreciated mechanism for MPN risk through modulation of HSC function.",Downloaded successfully,/Volumes/Seagate_8TB/rxiv_072020/biorxiv.org/790626v1.pdf,Erik L.

The virus is spread by the Aedes species (sp.) mosquitoes in tropical and subtropical regions of the world. CHIKV causes Chikungunya fever (CHIKF), where the acute stage of infection is characterized by high fever, headache, rash, and polyarthralgia. In 30-40% of cases, patients develop a chronic stage with debilitating joint pain persisting for months to years imposing a burden on the population in terms of disability adjusted life years (DALY). Presently, no vaccines or treatment options are available for this infection. Prior investigations reveal that CHIKV infection is associated with bone pathology; however, the molecular mechanism underlying CHIKV-induced bone pathology remains poorly defined. Studies show that disruption of osteogenic differentiation and function of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMMSCs) can lead to bone pathologies. However, to date pathogenesis of CHIKV infection in this context has not been studied. In the current study, we investigated the susceptibility of BMMSCs to CHIKV and studied the effect of infection on BMMSCs-derived osteogenic cells. To our knowledge, for the first time we report that CHIKV can productively infect BMMSCs. We observed a decrease in the intracellular and extracellular alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and reduction in calcium phosphate deposition in infected cells compared to mock-infected control.

In response to different physiological states and demands TCNs can fire in tonic and/or phasic burst modes. These firing properties of TCNs are supported by precisely timed inhibitory synaptic inputs from the thalamic reticular nucleus and intrinsic currents, including T-type Ca2+ and HCN currents. These intrinsic currents are mediated by Cav3.1 and HCN channel subunits, and alterations in expression or modulation of these channels can have dramatic implications on thalamus function. The factors that regulate these currents controlling the firing patterns important for integration of the sensory stimuli and the consequences resulting from the disruption of these firing patterns are not well understood. Shox2 is a transcription factor known to be important for pacemaker activity in the heart. We show here that Shox2 is also expressed in adult mouse thalamus. We hypothesized that genes regulated by Shox2’s transcriptional activity may be important for physiological properties of TCNs. In this study, we used RNA sequencing on control and Shox2 knockout mice to determine Shox2-affected genes and revealed a network of ion channel genes important for neuronal firing properties. Quantitative PCR confirmed that expression of Hcn2, 4 and Cav3.1 genes were affected by Shox2 KO. Western blotting showed expression of the proteins for these channels was decreased in the thalamus, and electrophysiological recordings showed that Shox2 KO impacted the firing and synaptic properties of TCNs. Finally, behavioral studies revealed that Shox2 expression in TCNs play a role in somatosensory function and object recognition memory.

Using this system, we took a candidate gene approach to screen for fetal-specific proliferative gene programs that can induce proliferation of adult mouse cardiomyocytes. Using pooled gene delivery and subtractive gene elimination, we identified a novel functional interaction between E2f Transcription Factor 2 (E2f2) and Brain Expressed X-Linked (Bex)/Transcription elongation factor A-like (Tceal) superfamily members Bex1 and Tceal8. Specifically, Bex1 and Tceal8 both preserved cell viability during E2f2-induced cell cycle re-entry. Although Tceal8 inhibited E2f2-induced S-phase re-entry, Bex1 facilitated DNA synthesis while inhibiting cell death. In sum, our study provides a valuable method for adult cardiomyocyte proliferation research and suggests that Bex family proteins may function in modulating cell proliferation and death decisions during cardiomyocyte development and maturation.",Downloaded successfully,/Volumes/Seagate_8TB/rxiv_072020/biorxiv.org/755991v1.pdf,Justin Judd; Jonathan Lovas; Guo N.

Evidence suggests that HHT pathogenesis strongly relies on overactivated PI3K-Akt-mTOR and VEGFR2 pathways in endothelial cells (ECs).

Sirolimus plus nintedanib prevented vascular pathology in the oral mucosa, lungs, and liver of the BMP9/10ib mice, as well as significantly reduced gastrointestinal bleeding and anemia in inducible ALK1-deficient adult mice. Mechanistically, in vivo in BMP9/10ib mouse ECs, sirolimus and nintedanib blocked the overactivation of mTOR and VEGFR2, respectively. Furthermore, we found that sirolimus activated ALK2-mediated Smad1/5/8 signaling in primary ECs—including in HHT patient blood outgrowth ECs—and partially rescued Smad1/5/8 activity in vivo in BMP9/10ib mouse ECs.

Thirty-five birds grown in captivity were included in the study and allocated into groups according to their respective body condition scores: Lean, Ideal and Obese. The echocardiographic evaluation revealed that obese parrots presented lower right ventricle dimensions in diastole than lean parrots. The fractional shortening was considerably lower in obese parrots than in parrots with lean and ideal body condition scores, but without statistical significance. The flow rate and the aortic pressure gradient were lower in the lean group than in the ideal group. No differences were observed between the groups when comparing the radiographic and tomographic measurements. Therefore, as is the case in mammals, we can conclude that alterations in the nutritional state of blue-fronted amazon parrots lead to cardiovascular dysfunctions detected only through an echocardiographic evaluation, which represents an important diagnostic tool for these animals. Computed tomography scans allowed a better identification of the structures of the cardiovascular system without the overlaying structures of the celomatic cavity observed in radiographic images.

Recent technological advances allow for finite element models of heart ventricles and atria to be customized to medical images and to assimilate electrical and hemodynamic measurements. Optimizing model parameters to physiological data is, however, challenging due to the computational complexity of finite element models. Metaheuristic algorithms and other optimization strategies typically require sampling hundreds of points in the model parameter space before converging to optimal solutions. Similarly, resolving uncertainty of model outputs to input assumptions is difficult for finite element models due to their computational cost. In this paper, we present a novel, multifidelity strategy for model order reduction of 3-D finite element models of ventricular mechanics. Our approach is centered around well established findings on the similarity between contraction of an isolated muscle and the whole ventricle. Specifically, we demonstrate that simple linear transformations between sarcomere strain (tension) and ventricular volume (pressure) are sufficient to reproduce global pressure-volume outputs of 3-D finite element models even by a reduced model with just a single myocyte unit. We further develop a procedure for congruency training of a surrogate low-order model from multi-scale finite elements, and we construct an example of parameter optimization based on medical images. We discuss how the presented approach might be employed to process large datasets of medical images as well as databases of echocardiographic reports, paving the way towards application of heart mechanics models in the clinical practice.",Downloaded successfully,/Volumes/Seagate_8TB/rxiv_072020/biorxiv.org/694075v2.pdf,Paolo Di Achille; Jaimit Parikh; Svyatoslav Khamzin; Olga Solovyova; James Kozloski; Viatcheslav Gurev,,Paolo Di Achille,,Viatcheslav Gurev,,

Further, acquiring successful intracellular recordings is very tedious, requiring a high degree of skill not readily achieved in a typical laboratory. We report here a robotic, MEMS-based intracellular recording system to overcome the above limitations associated with form-factor, scalability and highly skilled and tedious manual operations required for intracellular recordings. This system combines three distinct technologies: 1) novel microscale, glass-polysilicon penetrating electrode for intracellular recording, 2) electrothermal microactuators for precise microscale movement of each electrode and 3) closed-loop control algorithm for autonomous positioning of electrode inside single neurons. Here, we demonstrate the novel, fully integrated system of glass-polysilicon microelectrode, microscale actuators and controller for autonomous intracellular recordings from single neurons in the abdominal ganglion of Aplysia Californica (n = 5 cells). Consistent resting potentials (< −35 mV) and action potentials (> 60 mV) were recorded after each successful penetration attempt with the controller and microactuated glass-polysilicon microelectrodes. The success rate of penetration and quality of intracellular recordings achieved using electrothermal microactuators were comparable to that of conventional positioning systems. The MEMS-based system offers significant advantages: 1) reduction in overall size for potential use in behaving animals, 2) scalable approach to potentially realize multi-channel recordings and 3) a viable method to fully automate measurement of intracellular recordings.

Consequently, cells operate a poorly understood quality control programme of mitophagy to facilitate elimination of dysfunctional mitochondria. Here we use a model stressor, deferiprone (DFP), to investigate the molecular basis for stress-induced mitophagy. We show that mitochondrial fission 1 protein (Fis1) is required for DFP-induced mitophagy and that Fis1 is SUMOylated at K149, an amino acid residue critical for Fis1 mitochondrial localization. We find that DFP treatment leads to the stabilisation of the SUMO protease SENP3, which is mediated by downregulation of the E3 ubiquitin (Ub) ligase CHIP. SENP3 is responsible for Fis1 deSUMOylation and depletion of SENP3 abolishes DFP-induced mitochondrial mitophagy. Furthermore, preventing Fis1 SUMOylation by conservative K149R mutation enhances Fis1 mitochondrial localization. Critically, expressing a Fis1 K149R mutant restores DFP-induced mitophagy in SENP3 depleted cells. Thus, we propose a model in which SENP3-mediated deSUMOylation facilitates Fis1 mitochondrial localization to underpin stress-induced mitophagy.",Downloaded successfully,/Volumes/Seagate_8TB/rxiv_072020/biorxiv.org/685834v1.pdf,Emily Waters; Kevin A.

Gene mutations causing HCM have been found in about half of the patients, while the genetic etiology and pathogenesis remain unknown for many cases of HCM. To identify novel mechanisms underlying HCM pathogenesis, we generated a cardiovascular-mutant medaka fish non-spring heart (nsh), which showed diastolic dysfunction and hypertrophic myocardium. The nsh homozygotes had fewer myofibrils, disrupted sarcomeres and expressed pathologically stiffer titin isoforms. In addition, the nsh heterozygotes showed M-line disassembly that is similar to the pathological changes found in HCM. Positional cloning revealed a missense mutation in an immunoglobulin (Ig) domain located in the M-line-A-band transition zone of titin. Screening of mutations in 96 unrelated patients with familial HCM, who had no previously implicated mutations in known sarcomeric gene candidates, identified two mutations in Ig domains close to the M-line region of titin. In vitro studies revealed that the mutations found in both medaka fish and in familial HCM increased binding of titin to muscle-specific ring finger protein 1 (MURF1) and enhanced titin degradation by ubiquitination.

Computer algorithms that can automatically track and quantify myocardial motion and cardiac blood flow are highly sought after, but have not been very successful due to noise and high variability of echocardiography. In this work, we propose a neural multi-scale self-supervised registration (NMSR) method for automated myocardial and cardiac blood flow dense tracking. NMSR incorporates two novel components: 1) utilizing a deep neural net to parameterize the velocity field between two image frames, and 2) optimizing the parameters of the neural net in a sequential multi-scale fashion to account for large variations within the velocity field. Experiments demonstrate that NMSR yields significantly better registration accuracy than the state-of-the-art methods, such as advanced normalization tools (ANTs) and Voxel Morph, for both myocardial and cardiac blood flow dense tracking.

Single-cell genomics represents an ideal platform to enable the identification and comparison of normal and diseased transcriptional cell states.

Thus, we created cellHarmony, an integrated solution for the unsupervised analysis and classification of cell types from diverse scRNA-Seq datasets. cellHarmony is an automated and easy-to-use tool that efficiently matches single-cell transcriptomes using a community clustering and alignment strategy. Utilizing core genes and community clustering to reveal disease and cell-state systems-level insights overcomes bias toward donor and disease effects that can be imposed by joint-alignment approaches. Moreover, cellHarmony directly compares cell frequencies and gene expression in a cell-type-specific manner, then produces a holistic representation of these differences across potentially dozens of cell populations and impacted regulatory networks. Using this approach, we identify gene regulatory programs that are selectively impacted in distinct hematopoietic and heart cell populations that suggest novel disease mechanisms and drug targets.

Currently, the non-autonomous regulation of age-related cardiac dysfunction is poorly understood. In the present study, we discover that age-dependent induction of cytokine unpaired 3 (Upd3) in Drosophila oenocytes (hepatocyte-like cells), due to a dampened peroxisomal import function, is the primary non-autonomous mechanism for elevated arrhythmicity in old hearts. We show that Upd3 is significantly up-regulated (52-fold) in aged oenocytes. Oenocyte-specific knockdown of Upd3 is sufficient to block aging-induced cardiac arrhythmia. We further show that the age-dependent induction of Upd3 is triggered by impaired peroxisomal import and elevated JNK signaling in aged oenocytes. Intriguingly, oenocyte-specific over-expression of Pex5, the key peroxisomal import receptor, restores peroxisomal import, blocks age-related Upd3 induction, and alleviates aging- and paraquat-induced cardiac arrhythmicity.

Using time resolved x-ray diffraction in intact, contracting muscle, we simultaneously measured the myofilament lattice spacing, packing structure, and macroscopic force production of these muscle to test if nanoscale differences could account for this conundrum. While the packing patterns are the same, one muscle has 1 nm smaller lattice spacing at rest.

However, marked impairments in threat extinction learning coupled with impaired neuroplasticity in patients strongly impede the efficacy of exposure-based interventions.

However, the efficacy of pharmacological modulation of the RA system to enhance threat extinction in humans and the underlying neural mechanisms remain unclear. The present pre-registered, randomized placebo-controlled pharmacological neuroimaging trial demonstrates that pre-extinction administration of the angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist losartan accelerated attenuation of the psychophysiological threat response during extinction. On the neural level the acceleration of extinction was accompanied by threat-signal specific enhanced ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) activation and its coupling with the basolateral amygdala. Multivoxel pattern analysis and voxel-wise mediation analysis further revealed that that losartan reduced the neural threat expression, particularly in the vmPFC, and confirmed that acceleration of extinction critically involved treatment-induced modulation of vmPFC activation. Overall the results provide the first evidence for a pivotal role of the RA system in extinction learning in humans and suggest that adjunct losartan administration can be leveraged to facilitate the efficacy of extinction-based therapies.",Downloaded successfully,/Volumes/Seagate_8TB/rxiv_072020/biorxiv.org/512657v3.pdf,Feng Zhou; Yayuan Geng; Fei Xin; Jialin Li; Pan Feng; Congcong Liu; Weihua Zhao; Tingyong Feng; Adam J.

Cardiac fibroblasts are responsible for preserving the structural integrity of the myocardium and play a key role in regulating its repair and remodeling following stress or injury. We investigated expression and function of Piezo1 in cultured human and mouse cardiac fibroblasts. RT-PCR studies confirmed expression of Piezo1 mRNA in cardiac fibroblasts at similar levels to endothelial cells. Fura-2 intracellular Ca2+ measurements validated Piezo1 as a functional ion channel that was activated by the Piezo1 agonist, Yoda1. Yoda1-induced Ca2+ entry was inhibited by Piezo1 blockers (gadolinium, ruthenium red) and the Ca2+ response was reduced proportionally by Piezo1 siRNA knockdown or in cells from Piezo1+/− mice. Investigation of Yoda1 effects on selected remodeling genes indicated that Piezo1 activation opposed cardiac fibroblast differentiation; data confirmed by functional collagen gel contraction assays. Piezo1 activation using Yoda1 or mechanical stretch also increased the expression of interleukin-6 (IL-6), a mechanosensitive pro-hypertrophic and pro-fibrotic cytokine, in a Piezo1-dependent manner. Multiplex kinase activity profiling combined with kinase inhibitor studies and phospho-specific western blotting, established that Piezo1 activation stimulated IL-6 secretion via a pathway involving p38 MAP kinase, downstream of Ca2+ entry.

Many existing estimates of this association are affected by endogeneity bias caused by simultaneity, measurement error and omitted variables. The contribution of this study is to avoid this bias by using a novel identification strategy – random germline genetic variation in an instrumental variable analysis – to identify the presence and magnitude of the causal effect of BMI on inpatient hospital costs. We also use data on genetic variants to undertake much richer testing of the sensitivity of results to potential violations of the instrumental variable assumptions than is possible with existing approaches. Using data on over 300,000 individuals, we found effect sizes for the marginal unit of BMI more than 50% larger than multivariable effect sizes. These effects attenuated under sensitivity analyses, but remained larger than multivariable estimates for all but one estimator. There was little evidence for non-linear effects of BMI on hospital costs. Within-family estimates, intended to address dynastic biases, were null but suffered from low power. This paper is the first to use genetic variants in a Mendelian Randomization framework to estimate the causal effect of BMI (or any other disease/trait) on healthcare costs.

In this study, we uncover a role for Kindlin-3 in the differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) down the chondrogenic lineage. Kindlin-3 expression increased with chondrogenic differentiation similar to RUNX2. BMSCs isolated from a Kindlin-3 deficient patient expressed chondrocyte markers including SOX9 under basal conditions, which were further enhanced with chondrogenic differentiation. Rescue of integrin activation by a constitutively activated β3 integrin construct increased adhesion to multiple extracellular matrices and reduced SOX9 expression to basal levels.

Dysregulation of cardiolipin synthesis and remodeling have also been implicated in several diseases, such as diabetes, heart disease and Barth Syndrome. Although cardiolipin’s structural and dynamic roles have been extensively studied in binary mixtures with other phospholipids, the biophysical properties of cardiolipin in ternary lipid mixtures are still not well resolved. Here, we used molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the cardiolipin-dependent properties of ternary lipid bilayer systems that mimic the major components of mitochondrial membranes. We found that changes to cardiolipin concentration only resulted in minor changes to bilayer structural features, but that the lipid diffusion was significantly affected by those alterations. We also found that cardiolipin position along the bilayer surfaces correlated to negative curvature deflections, consistent with the induction of negative curvature stress in the membrane monolayers. This work contributes to a foundational understanding of the role of CL in altering the properties in ternary lipid mixtures composed of the major mitochondrial phospholipids, providing much needed insights to help understand how cardiolipin concentration modulates the biophysical properties of mitochondrial membranes.",Downloaded successfully,/Volumes/Seagate_8TB/rxiv_072020/biorxiv.org/557744v1.pdf,Blake A.

To test this, we performed genome-wide chromosome conformation analyses (Hi-C) in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) with a haploinsufficient mutation for lamin A/C. Compared to gene-corrected cells, mutant hiPSC-CMs have marked electrophysiological and contractile alterations, with modest gene expression changes. While large-scale changes in chromosomal topology are evident, differences in chromatin compartmentalization are limited to a few hotspots that escape inactivation during cardiogenesis. These regions exhibit upregulation of multiple non-cardiac genes including CACNA1A, encoding for neuronal P/Q-type calcium channels. Pharmacological inhibition of the resulting current partially mitigates the electrical alterations. On the other hand, A/B compartment changes do not explain most gene expression alterations in mutant hiPSC-CMs. We conclude that global errors in chromosomal compartmentation are not the primary pathogenic mechanism in heart failure due to lamin A/C haploinsufficiency.",Downloaded successfully,/Volumes/Seagate_8TB/rxiv_072020/biorxiv.org/555250v1.pdf,Alessandro Bertero; Paul A.

As changes in the haemodynamic environment strongly influence endothelial function and contribute to plaque development, we reconstructed the coronary artery geometries of plaques with thrombi overlying intact fibrous caps from 17 ACS patients and performed computational fluid dynamic analysis. The results demonstrated that erosions frequently occur within areas of stenosis exposed to elevated flow. We recapitulated this flow environment in vitro, exposing human coronary artery endothelial cells to elevated flow and modelled smoking (a risk factor for erosion) by exposure to a combination of aqueous cigarette smoke extract and TNFα. This treatment induced endothelial detachment, which increased with pharmacological activation of the antioxidant system controlled by transcription factor Nrf2 (encoded by NFE2L2). The expression of Oxidative Stress Growth INhibitor genes OSGIN1 and OSGIN2 increased under these conditions and also in the aortas of mice exposed to cigarette smoke. Sustained high level expression of OSGIN1+2 resulted in cell cycle arrest, induction of senescence, loss of focal adhesions and actin stress fibres, and dysregulation of autophagy. Overexpression of either Nrf2 or OSGIN1+2 induced cell detachment, which did not depend on apoptosis, and could be partially rescued by inhibition of HSP70 using VER-155008, or AMP kinase activation using metformin. These findings demonstrate that under elevated flow, smoking-induced hyperactivation of Nrf2 can trigger endothelial cell detachment, highlighting a novel mechanism that could contribute to ACS involving endothelial erosion overlying stenotic plaques.",Downloaded successfully,/Volumes/Seagate_8TB/rxiv_072020/biorxiv.org/537852v1.pdf,Sandro Satta; Michael McElroy; Alex Langford Smith; Glenn R Ferris; Jack Teasdale; Yongcheol Kim; Giampaolo Niccoli; Tom Tanjeko Ajime; Jef Serré; Georgina Hazell; Graciela Sala Newby; Ping Wang; Jason L Johnson; Martin J Humphries; Ghislaine Gayan-Ramirez; Peter Libby; Filippo Crea; Hans Degens; Frank Gijsen; Thomas Johnson; Amir Keshmiri; Yvonne Alexander; Andrew C Newby; Stephen J White,,Sandro Satta,,Stephen J White,,

We developed a 3D/stochastic multicompartmental computational model of CLEC-2 signalling, which was built around membrane-associated signalosome formation. The model predicted that both Syk and Src-family kinases phosphorylate CLEC-2, and that CLEC-2 ligation induces cytosolic calcium spiking. This was experimentally confirmed using flow cytometry and TIRF microscopy, respectively. Sensitivity analysis suggested that the CLEC-2 translocation to the signalosome region is one of the rate-limiting steps in the signal transduction process. In agreement with this prediction, CLEC-2-induced platelet activation was strongly temperature-dependent (unlike that mediated by G-protein coupled receptors) and was delayed by lipid raft disruption.

Central adrenergic signaling modulates the tone of this vagal output; however the exact excitability mechanisms are not fully understood. We investigated responses of NAm neurons to adrenergic agonists using in vitro mouse brainstem slices. Preganglionic NAm neurons were identified by Chat-tdtomato fluorescence in young adult transgenic mice and their cardiac projection confirmed by retrograde dye tracing. Juxtacellular recordings detected sparse or absent spontaneous action potentials (AP) in NAm neurons. However bath application of epinephrine or norepinephrine strongly and reversibly activated most NAm neurons regardless of their basal firing rate. Epinephrine was more potent than norepinephrine, and this activation largely depends on α1-adrenoceptors. Interestingly, adrenergic activation of NAm neurons does not require an ionotropic synaptic mechanism, since postsynaptic excitatory or inhibitory receptor blockade did not occlude the excitatory effect, and bath-applied adrenergic agonists did not alter excitatory or inhibitory synaptic transmission. Instead, adrenergic agonists significantly elevated intrinsic membrane excitability to facilitate generation of recurrent action potentials. T-type calcium current (ICaT) and hyperpolarization-activated current (Ih) are involved in this excitation pattern, while not required for spontaneous AP induction by epinephrine. In contrast, pharmacological blockade of persistent sodium current (INaP) significantly inhibited the adrenergic effects. Our results demonstrate that central adrenergic signaling enhances the intrinsic excitability of NAm neurons, and persistent sodium current is required for this effect.

The platform included WGS, comprehensive quantitative non-contrast whole body (WB) and brain magnetic resonance imaging/angiography (MRI/MRA), computed tomography (CT) coronary artery calcium scoring, electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, continuous cardiac monitoring, clinical laboratory tests, and metabolomics. In our cohort, 24.3% had medically significant genetic findings (MSF) which may contribute to increased risk of disease. A total of 206 unique medically significant variants in 111 genes were identified, and forty individuals (3.4%) had more than one MSF. Phenotypic testing revealed: 34.2% of our cohort had a metabolomics profile suggestive of insulin resistance, 29.2% had elevated liver fat identified by MRI, 16.4% had clinically important cardiac structure or cardiac function abnormalities on cardiac MRI or ECHO, 8.8% had a high cardiovascular risk on CT coronary artery calcium scoring (Agatston calcium score > 400, Relative Risk of 7.2), 8.0% had arrhythmia found on continuous rhythm monitoring, 6.5% had cardiac conduction disorders found on EKG, 2% had previously undetected tumors detected by WB MRI, and 2.5% had previously undetected aneurysms detected by non-contrast MRI/MRA.

Blood perfusion, capillary density, CD31, and VEGF protein levels were significantly higher in those groups received LLLT compared to control and DM group. Low level LASER significantly increased ERK phosphorylation and HIF-1α expression. In addition, phospho-eNOS was increased but iNOS protein level was decreased in mice received LASER treatment.

Most mammals, including humans, show obvious aging phenotypes, for example, loss of tissue plasticity and sarcopenia. In this regard, fish provide attractive models because of their unique aging characteristics. First, the lifespan of fish is highly varied and some long-lived fish can live for over 200 years. Second, some fish show anti-aging features and indeterminate growth throughout their life. Because these characteristics are not found in mammalian model organisms, exploring mechanisms of senescence in fish is expected to provide new insights into vertebrate aging. Therefore, we conducted transcriptome analysis for brain, gill, heart, liver and muscle from 2-month-, 7-month-, 16month- and 39-month-old zebrafish. In addition, we downloaded RNA-seq data for sequential age related gene expression in brain, heart, liver and muscle of rat (1).

We propose reverse GWAS (RGWAS) to identify and validate subtypes using genetics and multiple traits: while GWAS seeks the genetic basis of a given trait, RGWAS seeks to define trait subtypes with distinct genetic bases. Unlike existing approaches relying on off-the-shelf clustering methods, RGWAS uses a bespoke decomposition, MFMR, to model covariates, binary traits, and population structure. We use extensive simulations to show these features can be crucial for power and calibration. We validate RGWAS in practice by recovering known stress subtypes in major depressive disorder. We then show the utility of RGWAS by identifying three novel subtypes of metabolic traits. We biologically validate these metabolic subtypes with SNP-level tests and a novel polygenic test: the former recover known metabolic GxE SNPs; the latter suggests genetic heterogeneity may explain substantial missing heritability.

The impact of experimental models or hypertension treatment modalities on organ-specific vascular remodeling remains undefined. A wide variety of arterial remodeling types has been demonstrated for hypertensive models, which include differences across organs. The purpose of this study was to reassess methods for measurement of arterial remodeling and to establish a morphometric algorithm for standard and comparable quantification of vascular remodeling in hypertension in different vascular beds. We performed a novel and comprehensive morphometric analysis of terminal arteries in the brain, heart, lung, liver, kidney, spleen, stomach, intestine, skin, skeletal muscle, and adrenal glands of control and Goldblatt hypertensive rats on routinely processed tissue sections. Mean dimensions were highly variable but grouping them into sequential 5 μm intervals permitted creation of reliable linear regression equations and complex profiles. Averaged arterial dimensions demonstrated seven remodeling patterns that were distinct from conventional inward-outward and hypertrophic-eutrophic definitions. Numerical modeling predicted at least twenty variants of arterial spatial conformations. Recognition of remodeling variants was not possible using averaged dimensions, their ratios, or the remodeling and growth index. To distinguish remodeling patterns, a three-dimensional modeling was established and tested. The proposed algorithm permits quantitative analysis of arterial remodeling in different organs and may be applicable for comparative studies between animal hypertensive models and in human hypertension. Arterial wall tapering is the most important factor to consider in arterial morphometry, while perfusion fixation with vessel relaxation is not necessary. Terminal arteries in organs undergo the same remodeling pattern in Goldblatt rats, except for organs with hemodynamics affected by the arterial clip.

Here we provide quantitative evidence that this criterion is met for the prevention of genetic prion disease. We assemble age of onset or death data from N=1,094 individuals with high penetrance mutations in the prion protein gene (PRNP), generate survival and hazard curves, and estimate statistical power for clinical trials. We show that, due to dramatic and unexplained variability in age of onset, randomized preventive trials would require hundreds or thousands of at-risk individuals in order to be statistically powered for an endpoint of clinical onset, posing prohibitive cost and delay and likely exceeding the number of individuals available for such trials. Instead, the characterization of biomarkers suitable to serve as surrogate endpoints will be essential for the prevention of genetic prion disease.

We determine the synchronization coefficient Sync as the fraction of time fragments where the standard deviation of the differences between instantaneous phases of blood pressure and pulse intervals are below a certain threshold. While BRS characterizes the intensity of the pulse intervals response to the blood pressure changes during observed feedback responses, the Sync likely indicates how often such responses are activated in the first place. Data from 95 tilt test records indicate that in both healthy subjects and patients with moderate autonomic dysfunction BRS and Sync are typically reciprocal suggesting that low intensity of the feedback responses characterized by low BRS is rather compensated by their more frequent activation indicated by higher Sync. In contrast, in diabetes patients with autonomic neuropathy BRS and Sync are positively correlated likely indicating the breakdown of this compensation in some of the diabetic patients. Therefore we suggest that Sync could be used as an additional indicator of the blood pressure – heart rate feedback regulation activity that is complementary to the widely used baroreflex sensitivity (BRS).",Downloaded successfully,/Volumes/Seagate_8TB/rxiv_072020/biorxiv.org/397208v1.pdf,Nikita S Pyko; Svetlana A Pyko; Oleg A Markelov; Oleg V Mamontov; Mikhail I Bogachev,,Nikita S Pyko,,Mikhail I Bogachev,,

It is widely known that EADs are promoted by increasing inward currents and/or decreasing outward currents, a condition called reduced repolarization reserve. Recent studies based on bifurcation theories show that EADs are caused by a dual Hopf-homoclinic bifurcation, bringing in further mechanistic insights into the genesis and dynamics of EADs. In this study, we investigated the EAD properties, such as the EAD amplitude, the inter-EAD interval, and the latency of the first EAD, and their major determinants. We first made predictions based on the bifurcation theory and then validated them in physiologically more detailed action potential models. These properties were investigated by varying one parameter at a time or using parameter sets randomly drawn from assigned intervals. The theoretical and simulation results were compared with experimental data from the literature. Our major findings are that the EAD amplitude and takeoff potential exhibit a negative linear correlation; the inter-EAD interval is insensitive to the maximum ionic current conductance but mainly determined by the kinetics of ICa,L and the dual Hopf-homoclinic bifurcation; and both inter-EAD interval and latency vary largely from model to model. Most of the model results generally agree with experimental observations in isolated ventricular myocytes. However, a major discrepancy between modeling results and experimental observations is that the inter-EAD intervals observed in experiments are mainly between 200 and 500 ms, irrespective of species, while those of the mathematical models exhibit a much wider range with some models exhibiting inter-EAD intervals less than 100 ms. Our simulations show that the cause of this discrepancy is likely due to the difference in ICa,L recovery properties in different mathematical models, which needs to be addressed in future action potential model development.",Downloaded successfully,/Volumes/Seagate_8TB/rxiv_072020/biorxiv.org/373266v1.pdf,Xiaodong Huang; Zhen Song; Zhilin Qu,,Xiaodong Huang,,Zhilin Qu,,

In the EAT of atherosclerotic microswine that were fed with deficient, sufficient or supplemented levels of vitamin D, we evaluated the phenotype of the macrophages. Vitamin D treatment was continued for 12 months and serum 25(OH)D levels were measured regularly. Infiltration of M1/M2 macrophage was investigated by immunostaining for CCR7 and CD206, respectively in conjunction with a pan macrophage marker CD14. Significant difference in the number of CCR7+ cells was observed in the EAT from vitamin D-deficient swine compared to vitamin D-sufficient or -supplemented swine. Expression of CD206 correlated with high levels of serum 25(OH)D indicating a significant increase in M2 macrophages in the EAT of vitamin D-supplemented compared to -deficient swine. These findings suggest that vitamin D-deficiency exacerbates inflammation by increasing pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages, while vitamin D-supplementation attenuates the inflammatory cytokines and promotes M2 macrophages in EAT.

In a previous paper, we presented our initial work in developing an online resource for the characterisation and comparison of electrophysiological cell models in a wide range of experimental scenarios. In that work, we described how we had developed a novel protocol language that allowed us to separate the details of the mathematical model (the majority of cardiac cell models take the form of ordinary differential equations) from the experimental protocol being simulated. We developed a fully-open online repository (which we termed the Cardiac Electrophysiology Web Lab) which allows users to store and compare the results of applying the same experimental protocol to competing models. In the current paper we describe the most recent and planned extensions of this work, focused on supporting the process of model building from experimental data. We outline the necessary work to develop a machine-readable language to describe the process of inferring parameters from wet lab datasets, and illustrate our approach through a detailed example of fitting a model of the hERG channel using experimental data. We conclude by discussing the future challenges in making further progress in this domain towards our goal of facilitating a fully reproducible approach to the development of cardiac cell models.",Downloaded successfully,/Volumes/Seagate_8TB/rxiv_072020/biorxiv.org/257683v2.pdf,Aidan C.

Building a more robust cellular powerhouse holds promise for protecting these organs in stressful conditions. Here, we demonstrate that NDUFAB1 (NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit AB1), acts as a powerful cardio-protector by enhancing mitochondrial energy biogenesis. In particular, NDUFAB1 coordinates the assembly of respiratory complexes I, II, and III and supercomplexes, conferring greater capacity and efficiency of mitochondrial energy metabolism. Cardiac-specific deletion of Ndufab1 in mice caused progressive dilated cardiomyopathy associated with defective bioenergetics and elevated ROS levels, leading to heart failure and sudden death. In contrast, transgenic overexpression of Ndufab1 effectively enhanced mitochondrial bioenergetics and protected the heart against ischemia-reperfusion injury. Our findings identify NDUFAB1 as a central endogenous regulator of mitochondrial energy and ROS metabolism and thus provide a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of heart failure and other mitochondrial bioenergetics-centered diseases.",Downloaded successfully,/Volumes/Seagate_8TB/rxiv_072020/biorxiv.org/302281v1.pdf,Tingting Hou; Rufeng Zhang; Chongshu Jian; Wanqiu Ding; Yanru Wang; Qi Ma; Xinli Hu; Heping Cheng; Xianhua Wang,,Tingting Hou,,Xianhua Wang,,

However, previous analyses are mostly limited to candidate SNPs and findings have not been consistently replicated. Here, we used polygenic risk scores (PRS) to test for genetic overlap between nsCL/P and seven biologically relevant facial phenotypes. Where evidence was found of genetic overlap, we used bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) to test the hypothesis that genetic liability to nsCL/P is causally related to implicated facial phenotypes. Across 5,804 individuals of European ancestry from two studies, we found strong evidence, using PRS, of genetic overlap between nsCL/P and philtrum width; a 1 S.D. increase in nsCL/P PRS was associated with a 0.10 mm decrease in philtrum width (95% C.I. 0.054, 0.146; P = 0.00002). Follow-up MR analyses supported a causal relationship; genetic variants for nsCL/P homogeneously cause decreased philtrum width. In addition to the primary analysis, we also identified two novel risk loci for philtrum width at 5q22.2 and 7p15.2 in our Genome-wide Association Study (GWAS) of 6,136 individuals.

Experimental studies demonstrated that Pitx2 insufficiency leads to cellular and molecular substrates that increased atrial arrhythmias susceptibility. Pitx2 expression is present not only in the atrial but also in the ventricular myocytes. This study aims to investigate if insufficiency of Pitx2 in the developing and adult ventricular chambers increased susceptibility to ventricular arrhythmias. Conditional Pitx2 loss-offunction ventricular chamber-specific (Mlc2v-Cre) mouse mutants were generated using Cre/loxP technology. Pitx2 insufficiency in the ventricular myocardium leads interventricular septal thickening during cardiogenesis but else mice are viable until adulthood. Adult Mlc2vCre+Pitx2-/- hearts display hypertrophic and dilated ventricular chambers. ECG recordings demonstrated that Mlc2vCre+Pitx2-/- mice display increased QT and QRS intervals. Molecular analyses demonstrate that repolarization but not depolarization is severely impaired in these mutants. Microarrays analysis identified mRNAs and microRNAs altered in Pitx2 ventricular-specific mutants and provide evidences for miR-1 and miR-148 deregulation which in turn modulate Klf4 and distinct ion channel expression linked to cardiac hypertrophy and long QT-like defects. Our data demonstrate that Pitx2 insufficiency play leads to cellular and molecular ventricular remodeling which results in hypertrophic and dilated ventricular chambers and electrophysiological defects resembling long QT syndrome.,Downloaded successfully,/Volumes/Seagate_8TB/rxiv_072020/biorxiv.org/253062v1.pdf,Ana Chinchilla; Francisco J Esteban; Estefanía Lozano-Velasco; Francisco Hernandez-Torres; Jorge N Dominguez; Amelia E Arànega; Diego Franco,,Ana Chinchilla,,Diego Franco,,

This species is currently maintained in a captive assurance colony and is managed to preserve the genetic diversity of the founding populations. However, it is unlikely that self-sustaining wild populations can be re-established unless Bd resistance increases. We performed a Bd-challenge study to investigate the association between genetic variants of the major histocompatibility complex class IA (MHC) and genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). We also investigated differences in Bd susceptibility among individuals and populations, and the genetic diversity and population genetic structure of four natural P. corroboree populations. We found several MHC alleles and SNPs associated with Bd infection load and survival, provide evidence of significant structure among populations, and identified population-level differences in the frequency of influential variants. We also detected evidence of positive selection acting on the MHC and a subset of SNPs as well as evidence of high genetic diversity in P. corroboree populations. We suggest that low interbreeding rates may have contributed to the demise of this species by limiting the spread of Bd resistance genes. However, our findings demonstrate that despite dramatic declines there is potential to restore high levels of genetic diversity in P. corroboree. Additionally, we show that there are immunogenetic differences among captive southern corroboree frogs, which could be manipulated to increase disease resistance and mitigate the key threatening process, chytridiomycosis.",Downloaded successfully,/Volumes/Seagate_8TB/rxiv_072020/biorxiv.org/247999v1.pdf,Tiffany A.

Drawing on hallmarks of aging, we link these concepts to candidate biological mechanisms through a framework that defines death as challenges to vitality where distal factors defined the age-evolution of vitality and proximal factors define the probability distribution of challenges. To illustrate the process point of view, we hypothesize that the immune system is a mortality nexus, characterized by two vitality streams: increasing vitality representing immune system development and immunosenescence representing vitality dissipation. Proximal challenges define three mortality partitions: juvenile and adult extrinsic mortalities and intrinsic adult mortality. Model parameters, generated from Swedish mortality data (1751-2010), exhibit biologically meaningful correspondences to economic, health and cause-of-death patterns. The model characterizes the 20th century epidemiological transition mainly as a reduction in extrinsic mortality resulting from a shift from high magnitude disease challenges on individuals at all vitality levels to low magnitude stress challenges on low vitality individuals. Of secondary importance, intrinsic mortality was described by a gradual reduction in the rate of loss of vitality presumably resulting from reduction in the rate of immunosenescence. Extensions and limitations of a distal/proximal framework for characterizing more explicit causes of death, e.g. the young adult mortality hump or cancer in old age are discussed.",Downloaded successfully,/Volumes/Seagate_8TB/rxiv_072020/biorxiv.org/067967v3.pdf,James J.

We captured demographic characteristics using a structured questionnaire; and measured anthropometric indices and BP. We performed a linear regression analysis to determine the relationship between RPR and blood pressure and plotted receiver operating characteristics curves (ROC) to assess the accuracy of RPR in defining high BP.

Hence an objective severity assessment is crucial in making therapeutic decisions judiciously. Computed Tomography (CT)-scans can provide demarcating features to identify the severity of pneumonia, commonly associated with COVID-19, in the affected lungs. Here, a semi-quantitative severity assessing lung CT image feature is demonstrated for COVID-19 patients. An open-source multi-center Italian database was used, among which 61 cases were incorporated in the study (age 27-86, 71% males) from 27 CT imaging centers. Lesions in the form of opacifications, crazy-paving patterns, and consolidations were heuristically marked and the severity determining feature L_norm was quantified and established to be statistically distinct for the three classes i.e., mild, moderate, and severe (p-value < 0.0001). The thresholds of L_norm for a 3-class classification were determined based on the optimum sensitivity/specificity combination from ROC analyses. The feature L_norm classified the cases in the three severity categories with 89.34% accuracy when L_norm was calculated based on experts' heuristic annotations. Substantial to almost-perfect intra-rater and inter-rater agreements were achieved involving expert and non-expert based evaluations (κ-score 0.79-0.97). We trained machine learning based classification models and showed L_norm alone has a superior diagnostic accuracy over standard image intensity and texture features. Classification accuracy was further increased when L_norm was used to delineate the severe cases from non-severe ones (98.9%) with high sensitivity (97.7%), and specificity (97.49%).

This study investigates the cross-sectional and longitudinal relationship of blood lipid and lipoprotein levels with leukocyte counts in the UK Biobank cohort.
Methods: The primary cross-sectional analysis included 417,132 participants with valid data on lipid measures and leukocyte counts. A subgroup analysis was performed in 333,668 participants with valid data on lipoprotein(a). The longitudinal analysis included 9,058 participants with valid baseline and follow-up data on lipid and lipoprotein levels and leukocyte counts. The association of lipid and lipoprotein levels with leukocyte counts was analysed by multivariable linear regression. 
Results: Several relationships were significant in both cross-sectional and longitudinal analysis. After adjustment for demographic, socioeconomic and other confounding factors a higher eosinophil count was associated with lower HDL cholesterol and apolipoproteinA-I concentration (p<0.001). Higher triglycerides levels were associated with higher total leukocyte, basophil, eosinophil, monocyte and neutrophil counts (all p<0.01). A higher lymphocyte count was associated with a higher apolipoprotein B level (p<0.001). In the longitudinal analysis lipoprotein(a) was inversely associated with basophil count in men but not women (p<0.001). 
Conclusion: Triglyceride levels demonstrate a robust positive association with total and differential leukocyte counts suggesting they may be directly involved in leuokogenesis.

This condition is not associated with a marked decrease in cardiac output or systemic pressure and therefore is more difficult to diagnose than its systolic counterpart. Compromised relaxation or increased stiffness of the left ventricle with or without mitral valve stenosis induces an increase in the upstream pulmonary pressures, and classified as secondary or group II (2018 Nice classification) pulmonary hypertension. This may result in an increase in the right ventricular afterload leading to right ventricular failure. Elevated pulmonary pressures are therefore an important clinical indicator of diastolic heart failure (sometimes referred to as ""heart failure with preserved ejection fraction""), showing significant correlation with associated mortality. Accurate measurements of this quantity, however, are typically obtained through invasive catheterization, and after the onset of symptoms. In this study, we use the hemodynamic consistency of a differential-algebraic circulation model to predict pulmonary pressures in adult patients from other, possibly non-invasive, clinical data. We investigate several aspects of the problem, including the well posedness of a modeling approach for this type of disease, identifiability of its parameters, to the accuracy of the predicted pulmonary pressures. We also find that a classifier using the assimilated model parameters as features is free from the problem of missing data and is able to detect pulmonary hypertension with sufficiently high accuracy.

Murine models have suggested involvement of Wnt signaling, but this has not been well defined in human RVF. 
Methods: Using a candidate gene approach, we sought to identify genes specifically expressed in human pathologic RV remodeling by assessing the expression of 28 WNT-related genes in the RVs of three groups: explanted nonfailing donors (NF, n = 29), explanted dilated and ischemic cardiomyopathy, obtained at the time of cardiac transplantation, either with preserved RV function (pRV, n = 78) or with RVF (n = 35).
Results: We identified the noncanonical WNT receptor ROR2 as transcriptionally strongly upregulated in RVF compared to pRV and NF (Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted p<0.05). ROR2 protein expression correlated linearly to mRNA expression (R2  = 0.41, p = 8.1x10-18) among all RVs, and to higher right atrial to pulmonary capillary wedge ratio in RVF (R2=0.40, p = 3.0x10-5). We compared RVF with high and low ROR2 expression, and found that high ROR2 expression was associated with increased expression of the WNT5A/ROR2/Ca2+ responsive protease calpain, cleavage of its target FLNA, and FLNA phosphorylation, another marker of activation downstream of ROR2. ROR2 protein expression as a continuous variable, correlated strongly to expression of calpain (R2 = 0.25), total FLNA (R2 = 0.67), and FLNA phosphorylation (R2  = 0.62, p < 0.05 for all).

CoV-2 neutralization was determined in COVID-19 and convalescent plasma up to 10,000-fold dilution, using Spike protein pseudotyped lentiviruses, which was also blocked by neutralizing antibodies (NAbs). Hospitalized patients had up to 3000-fold higher antibody and neutralization titers compared to outpatients or convalescent plasma donors. Further, subjects who donated plasma further out from the diagnosis of COVID-19 appeared to have lower titers.  Interestingly, some COVID-19 patients also contained NAbs against SARS Spike protein pseudovirus.

Deriving these models is challenging for several reasons, perhaps the most daunting being the limited number of already-diagnosed, 'labeled' patients from which to learn. We overcome this obstacle with a novel lightly-supervised algorithm that leverages unlabeled and/or unreliably-labeled patient data - which is typically plentiful - to facilitate model induction. Importantly, we prove the algorithm is safe: adding unlabeled/unreliably-labeled data to the learning procedure produces models which are usually more accurate, and guaranteed never to be less accurate, than models learned from reliably-labeled data alone. The proposed method is shown to substantially outperform state-of-the-art models in patient-finding experiments involving two different rare diseases and a country-scale EHR database.

 The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the patchwork nature of disease epidemics, with infection spread dynamics varying wildly across countries and across states within the US. These heteroge- neous patterns are also observed within individual states, with patches of concentrated outbreaks. Data is being generated daily at all of these spatial scales, and answers to questions regarded re- opening strategies are desperately needed. Mathematical modeling is useful in exactly these cases, and using modeling at a county scale may be valuable to further predict disease dynamics for the purposes of public health interventions. To explore this issue, we study and predict the spread of COVID-19 in Washtenaw County, MI, the home to University of Michigan, Eastern Michigan University, and Google, as well as serving as a sister city to Detroit, MI where there has been a serious outbreak. Here, we apply a discrete and stochastic network-based modeling framework allowing us to track every individual in the county. In this framework, we construct contact net- works based on synthetic population datasets specific for Washtenaw County that are derived from US Census datasets. We assign individuals to households, workplaces, schools, and group quarters (such as prisons). In addition, we assign casual contacts to each individual at random. Using this framework, we explicitly simulate Michigan-specific government-mandated workplace and school closures as well as social distancing measures. We also perform sensitivity analyses to identify key model parameters and mechanisms contributing to the observed disease burden in the three months following the first observed cases on COVID-19 in Michigan. We then consider several scenarios for relaxing restrictions and reopening workplaces to predict what actions would be most prudent. In particular, we consider the effects of 1) different timings for reopening, and 2) different levels of workplace vs. casual contact re-engagement. Through simulations and sensitivity analyses, we explore mechanisms driving magnitude and timing of a second wave of infections upon re-opening. This model can be adapted to other US counties using synthetic population databases and data specific to those regions.",Downloaded successfully,/Volumes/Seagate_8TB/rxiv_072020/medrxiv.org/2020.07.06.20147223v1.pdf,Marissa Renardy; Denise E.

The clinical standard for measuring respiration, namely Spirometry, is hardly suitable for continuous use. Wearables can track many physiological signals, like ECG and motion, yet not respiration. Deriving respiration from other modalities has become an area of active research. In this work, we infer respiratory parameters from wearable ECG and wrist motion signals. We propose a modular and generalizable classification-regression pipeline to utilize available context information, such as physical activity, in learning context-conditioned inference models. Morphological and power domain novel features from the wearable ECG are extracted to use with these models. Exploratory feature selection methods are incorporated in this pipeline to discover application-specific interpretable biomarkers. Using data from 15 subjects, we evaluate two implementations of the proposed pipeline: for inferring BR and VE. Each implementation compares generalized linear model, random forest, support vector machine, Gaussian process regression, and neighborhood component analysis as contextual regression models. Permutation, regularization, and relevance determination methods are used to rank the ECG features to identify robust ECG biomarkers across models and activities.

Unfortunately, the pursuit and use of such therapies have been hindered by a common challenge: patients with specific rare diseases are difficult to identify, especially if the conditions resemble more prevalent disorders. Cardiac amyloidosis is one such rare disease, which is characterized by deposition of misfolded proteins within the heart muscle resulting in heart failure and death. In recent years, specific therapies have emerged for cardiac amyloidosis and several more are under investigation, but because cardiac amyloidosis is mistaken for common forms of heart failure, it is typically diagnosed late in its course. As a possible solution, artificial intelligence methods could enable automated detection of rare diseases, but model performance must address low disease prevalence. Here we present an automated multi-modality pipeline for cardiac amyloidosis detection using two neural-network models; one using electrocardiograms (ECG) and the second using echocardiographic videos as input. These models were trained and validated on 3 and 5 academic medical centers (AMC), respectively, in the United States and Japan. Both models had excellent accuracy for detecting cardiac amyloidosis with C-statistics of 0.85-0.92 and 0.91-1.00 for the ECG and echocardiography models, respectively, with the latter outperforming expert diagnosis. Simulating deployment on 13,906 and 7775 patients with ECG-echocardiography paired data for AMC2 and AMC3 indicated a positive predictive value (PPV) for the ECG model of 4% and 3% at 61% and 54% recall, respectively. Pre-screening with ECG enhanced the echocardiography model performance from PPV 23% and 20% to PPV 58% and 53% at 64% recall, respectively for AMC2 and AMC3.

Methods: Consecutive patients admitted to public hospitals between 1st January and 24th May 2020 in Hong Kong with COVID-19 diagnosed by RT-PCR were included. The primary endpoint was ICU admission. 
Results: This study included 1043 patients (median age 35 (IQR: 32-37; 54% male). Nineteen patients were admitted to ICU (median hospital length of stay (LOS): 30 days, median ICU LOS: 16 days). ICU patients were more likely to be prescribed angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers, anti-retroviral drugs lopinavir/ritonavir and remdesivir, ribavirin, steroids, interferon-beta and hydroxychloroquine. Significant predictors of ICU admission were older age, male sex, prior coronary artery disease, respiratory diseases, diabetes, hypertension and chronic kidney disease, and activated partial thromboplastin time, red cell count, white cell count, albumin and serum sodium. A tree-based machine learning model identified most informative characteristics and hidden interactions that can predict ICU admission. These were: low red cells with 1) male, 2) older age, 3) low albumin, 4) low sodium or 5) prolonged APTT.

Background: There have been growing concerns about the speed and rigor of the review process for COVID-related articles by journals.

Methods: Using Dimensions, an online searchable platform, we identified PubMed-indexed journals that published >50 COVID-related articles (regardless of article type) between 1/1/2020 and 5/16/2020 and had available data on the date of article receipt. For the control group, we included consecutive full-length original investigations with available receipt date (regardless of topic) published in these journals starting from 3/1/2019 until a 1:2 ratio of COVID to non-COVID-related articles per journal was achieved.

Results: The final number included 294 COVID-related full-length original investigations with available article receipt dates published in 16 journals with corresponding 588 control articles from the same journals. The median time from article receipt to online publication was 20 (11-32) days for COVID-articles vs. 119 (62-182) days for controls (P<0.001).

We performed a phylogenetic analysis to reveal the spread dynamics detail of SARS-CoV-2 in China and the impact of travel ban on SARS-CoV-2.
Method. Focusing on SARS-CoV-2 sequences collected from China in public database released as of March 31, 2020, we performed a Bayesian inference phylogenetic analyses to estimate the effective population size (Ne) curve of SARS-CoV-2 epidemic. Furthermore, we displayed the geographic spread mode of SARS-CoV-2 among different China regions by using Bayesian stochastic search variable selection (BSSVS) method.
Results. The most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) of SARS-CoV-2 in China was traced back to December 9, 2019. According the Ne estimation and geographic spread reconstruction, January 25, 2020 was considered as the crucial time point during the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in China,which was 2 days after the travel ban implemented.

However, initial training of such networks requires large amounts of annotated data and generalization to different vendors, field strengths, sequence parameters, and pathologies is often limited. Transfer learning has been proposed to address this challenge, but specific recommendations on the type and amount of data required is lacking. In this study we aim to assess data requirements for transfer learning to cardiac 7T in humans where the segmentation task can be challenging. In addition, we provide guidelines, tools, and annotated data to enable transfer learning approaches of other researchers and clinicians. 
Methods A publicly available model for bi-ventricular segmentation is used to annotate a publicly available data set. This labelled data set is subsequently used to train a neural network for segmentation of left ventricular and myocardial contours in cardiac cine MRI. The network is used as starting point for transfer learning to the segmentation task on 7T cine data of healthy volunteers (n=22, 7873 images). Structured and random data subsets of different sizes were used to systematically assess data requirements for successful transfer learning.
Results Inconsistencies in the publically available data set were corrected, labels created, and a neural network trained. On 7T cardiac cine images the initial model achieved DICELV=0.835 and DICEMY=0.670. Transfer learning using 7T cine data and ImageNet weight initialization significantly (p<10-3) improved model performance to DICELV=0.900 and DICEMY=0.791.

However, it is little known whether HIIT program has an advantageous effect on patients after percutaneous coronary intervention or not.
Methods: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) focusing on HIIT program in patients after PCI were searched in Cochrane Library, Web of Science Core Collection, EMbase, PubMed, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) and SinoMed from the inception to March 24, 2020. Two reviewers conducted the literature retrieval, data extraction, and quality assessment independently. Standard Mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were performed to summarize the effect sizes. 
Results: 6 RCTs (247 patients) met the criteria. HIIT program had a statistically significant effect on raising left ventricular ejection function (LVEF) (SMD=0.38, 95%CI[0.03, 0.73], p=0.03), VO2peak (SMD=0.94, 95%CI[0.61, 1.28], p<0.01), as well as improving the serum level of high-density lipoprotein (SMD=0.55, 95%CI[0.06, 1.03], p=0.03) and late luminal loss (SMD=-0.65, 95%CI[-1.07, -0.23], p<0.01).

Conclusions: HIIT program might be favorable for CAD patients after PCI by improving cardiopulmonary function, such as LVEF and VO2peak, as well as reducing late luminal loss in per stented arteries.

With its rapid spread, since the beginning of the outbreak in December 2019, the disease transmitted by SARS-Cov2 has already caused over 400 thousand deaths to date. The diagnosis of the disease has an important role in combating Covid-19. Proposed method In this work, we propose a web system, Heg.IA, which seeks to optimize the diagnosis of Covid-19 through the use of artificial intelligence. The main ideia is that healthcare professionals can insert 41 hematological parameters from common blood tests and arterial gasometry into the system. Then, Heg.IA will provide a diagnostic report. It will indicate if the patient is infected with SARS-Cov2 virus, and also predict the type of hospitalization (regular ward, semi-ICU, or ICU). We developed a web system called Heg.IA to support decision-making regarding to diagnosis of Covid-19 and to the indication of hospitalization on regular ward, semi-ICU or ICU. This application is based on decision trees in a Random Forest architecture with 90 trees. The system showed to be highly efficient, with great results for both Covid-19 diagnosis and to recommend hospitalization. For the first scenario we found average results of accuracy of 92.891% ± 0.851, kappa index of 0.858 ± 0.017, sensitivity of 0.936 ± 0.011, precision of 0.923 ± 0.011, specificity of 0.921 ± 0.012 and area under ROC of 0.984 ± 0.003. As for the indication of hospitalization, we achieved excellent performance of accuracies above 99% and more than 0.99 for the other metrics in all situations. By using a computationally simple method, based on the classical decision trees, we were able to achieve high diagnosis performance. Heg.IA system may be a way to overcome the testing unavailability in the context of Covid-19.

Several observational studies have found an association between the A blood group and an increased susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection, whereas the O blood group appears to be protective.
Objective: To investigate the frequency and clinical course of COVID-19 in a large sample of patients who had undergone TAVR and to determine the associations of the ABO blood group with disease occurrence and outcomes.
Methods: Patients who had undergone TAVR between 2010 and 2019 were included in this study and followed-up through the recent COVID-19 outbreak. The main outcomes were the occurrence and severity (hospitalization and/or death) of COVID-19 and their association with the ABO blood group.
Results: Of the 1125 patients who had undergone TAVR, 403 (36%) died before January 1, 2020, and 20 (1.8%) were lost to follow-up. The study sample therefore consisted of 702 patients. Among them, we identified 22 cases (3.1%) with COVID-19. Fourteen patients (63.6%) were hospitalized or died of disease. Multivariate analysis identified the A blood group (versus others) as the only independent predictor of COVID-19 in patients who had undergone TAVR (odds ratio [OR] = 6.32; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.11−18.92; p=0.001).

Background and Aim: With the increase in the number of COVID-19 infections, global health is facing insufficient sources; this study aimed to provide additional data regarding the clinical characteristics of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and in particular to analyze the factors associated with disease severity, unimprovement and mortality. 
Methods: 82 studies were included in the present meta-analysis that all of them have been published before May 1, 2020 and were found by searching through the databases Scopus and MEDLINE. The selected papers were studied and analyzed by employing the version 14 of stata software. It should be noted that, we employed I2 statistics for testing and verifying heterogeneity. 

Results: 82 papers were finally chosen for this meta- analysis, including 74855 infected patients (35673 men, 31140 women). The mean age of the patients was 56.49. The results indicate the prevalence of fever 79.84 (95% CI: 75.22-84.13), cough 59.53 (95% CI: 55.35-63.65), fatigue or myalgia 33.46 (95% CI: 28.68-38.40), dyspnea 31.48 (95% CI: 25.75-37.49) and diarrhea 10.71 (95% CI: 8.20-13.49).

We monitored, collected and analyzed the data for 10,680 patients for a duration of more than 13 years. 12% of patients demonstrated DFU. Nephropathy was observed in 39% of patients; 43% was hypertensive while 15% demonstrated DKD or CKD. Levels of HbA1c, creatinine, , systolic and diastolic blood pressures, microalbuminuria, spot urine protein, and spot urine protein to creatinine ratio were higher among the groups with foot ulcers (p-value < 0.0001 for all). Average ABI was observed to be lower among the groups demonstrating nephropathy and DKD with significant p-values (p=0.025 and 0.022 respectively). Pearson's Chi square and logistic regression with odds ratio were also analyzed for DFU with HTN, nephropathy and DKD. DFU was significantly associated with HTN (odds ratio 2.2 ; 95% CI 1.66 to 2.9; p < 0.0001), nephropathy (odds ratio 4.77 ;95% CI 3.53 to 6.5; p < 0.0001) and DKD (odds ratio 4.77  and  6.83; 95% CI 4.6 to 10.2; p < 0.0001).

Antipsychotics are usually used for the pharmacological management of delirium, and confusion and behavioral disturbances. The selection of concomitant COVID-19 medications and antipsychotics should be evidence-based and closely monitored 

Objective:  To systematically review evidence-based available on drug-drug interactions between COVID-19 treatments and antipsychotics.

Evidence Review:  Three databases were consulted: (a) Lexicomp Drug Interactions, (b) Micromedex Solutions Drugs Interactions, (c) Liverpool  Drug Interaction Group for COVID-19 therapies. To acquire more information on QT prolongation and TdP, the CredibleMeds QTDrugs List was searched.  Based on the information collected, the authors made a recommendation agreed to by consensus. In addition, a systematic review was conducted to find the clinical outcomes of drug-drug interactions between COVID-19 treatments and antipsychotics

Results:  The main interaction between COVID-19 drugs and antipsychotics are the risk of QT prolongation and TdP, and CYP interactions. Remdesivir, favipiravir, baricinitib, and anakinra can be used concomitantly with antipsychotics with no risk of drug-drug interaction (except for hematological risk with clozapine and baricinitib). Tocilizumab is rather safe to use in combination with antipsychotics, although it can restore the activity of CYP3A4 and therefore its substrate metabolism may increase. The most demanding COVID-19 treatments for co-administration with antipsychotics are chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin (all prolong QT interval) and lopinavir / ritonavir (CYP interaction and risk of QT prolongation).

During the COVID-19 outbreak, reports have surfaced of children who present with features of a multisystem inflammatory syndrome with overlapping features of Kawasaki disease and toxic shock syndrome - Paediatric Inflammatory Multisystem Syndrome- temporally associated with SARS-CoV-2 pandemic (PIMS-TS). Initial reports find that many of the children are PCR-negative for SARS-CoV-2, so it is difficult to confirm whether this syndrome is a late complication of viral infection in an age group largely spared the worst consequences of this infection, or if this syndrome reflects enhanced surveillance.  
Methods. Children hospitalised for symptoms consistent with PIMS-TS between 28 April and 8 May 2020, and who were PCR-negative for SARS-CoV-2, were tested for antibodies to viral spike glycoprotein using an ELISA test. 
Results. Eight patients (age range 7-14 years, 63% male) fulfilled case-definition for PIMS-TS during the study period. Six of the eight patients required admission to intensive care. All patients exhibited significant IgG and IgA responses to viral spike glycoprotein. Further assessment showed that the IgG isotypes detected in children with PIMS-TS were of the IgG1 and IgG3 subclasses, a distribution similar to that observed in samples from hospitalised adult COVID-19 patients. In contrast, IgG2 and IgG4 were not detected in children or adults. IgM was not detected in children, which contrasts with adult hospitalised adult COVID-19 patients of whom all had positive IgM responses.
Conclusions. Strong IgG antibody responses can be detected in PCR-negative children with PIMS-TS. The low detection rate of IgM in these patients is consistent with infection having occurred weeks previously and that the syndrome onset occurs well after the control of SARS-CoV-2 viral load. This implies that the disease is largely immune-mediated. Lastly, this indicates that serology can be an appropriate diagnostic tool in select patient groups.",Downloaded successfully,/Volumes/Seagate_8TB/rxiv_072020/medrxiv.org/2020.06.05.20123117v1.pdf,Marisol Perez-Toledo; Sian E.

Objectives: The outbreak of the new Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has prompted investigations on various aspects. This research aims to study the possible correlation between the numbers of swab tests and confirmed cases of infection, with special attention to the sickness level. 
Study Design: The study is carried out with reference to the Italian case, but the result is of more general importance, in particular for countries with limited availability of ICUs (intensive care units).
Methods: 
The statistical analysis shows correlation between the number of swab tests and those of daily positive cases, mild cases admitted to hospital, intensive care cases, recovery, and death rate, and provides a basis to carry on an AI study. The results were validated using a multivariate linear regression (MLR) approach.
Results: Our main result is the identification of a significant statistical effect of reduction of the pressure on the Health system as result of the increase of the tests. The relevance of this result is not confined to the COVID-19 outbreak, because the high demand of hospitalizations and ICU treatments due to this pandemic has an indirect effect on the possibility of guaranteeing an adequate treatment for other high-fatality disease, such as e.g. cardiological, and oncological.

To explore the whole-brain dynamic functional network connectivity patterns in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients and their relation to stroke severity in the short and long term.  

Methods
We investigated large-scale dynamic functional network connectivity of 41 AIS patients two to five days after symptom onset. Re-occurring dynamic connectivity configurations were obtained using a sliding window approach and k-means clustering. We evaluated differences in dynamic patterns between three NIHSS-stroke severity defined groups (mildly, moderately, and severely affected patients). Furthermore, we established correlation analyses between dynamic connectivity estimates and AIS severity as well as neurological recovery within the first 90 days after stroke. Finally, we built Bayesian hierarchical models to predict acute ischemic stroke severity and examine the inter-relation of dynamic connectivity and clinical measures, with an emphasis on white matter hyperintensity lesion load.

Results
We identified three distinct dynamic connectivity configurations in the early post-acute stroke phase. More severely affected patients (NIHSS 10-21) spent significantly more time in a highly segregated dynamic connectivity configuration that was characterized by particularly strong connectivity (three-level ANOVA: p<0.05, post hoc t-tests: p<0.05, FDR-corrected for multiple comparisons). Recovery, as indexed by the realized change of the NIHSS over time, was significantly linked to the acute dynamic connectivity between bilateral intraparietal lobule and left angular gyrus (Pearson's r=-0.68, p<0.05, FDR-corrected). Increasing dwell times, particularly those in a very segregated connectivity configuration, predicted higher acute stroke severity in our Bayesian modelling framework. 

Conclusions
Our findings demonstrate transiently increased segregation between multiple functional domains in case of severe AIS.

Evidence suggests that MetS  accounts for the highest global mortality rate. For the early and accurate diagnosis of MetS, various statistical and ML techniques have been developed to support its clinical diagnosis. We performed a systematic  review to investigate the various statistical and machine learning techniques (ML) that have been used to support the clinical diagnoses of MetS from the earliest studies to January 2020. Published literature relating to statistical and ML techniques for the diagnosis of MetS were identified by searching five major scientific databases: PubMed, Science Direct, IEEE Xplore, ACM digital library, and SpringerLink. Fifty-three primary studies that met the inclusion criteria were obtained after screening titles, abstracts and full text.  Three main types of techniques were identified: statistical (n=10), ML (n=40), and risk quantification (n=3). Standardized Z-score is the  only statistical technique identified while the ML techniques include principal component analysis, confirmatory factory analysis, artificial neural networks, multiple logistics regression, decision trees, support vector machines, random forests, and Bayesian networks. The areal similarity degree risk quantification, framingham risk score and simScore were the three risk quantification techniques identified. Evidence suggests that evaluated ML techniques, with accuracy ranging from 75.5% to 98.9%, can more accurately diagnose MetS than both statistical and risk quantification techniques.   
The  standardised Z-score  is the most frequent statistical technique identified. However, highlighted proof based on performance measures indicate that the decision tree and artificial neural network ML techniques have the highest predictive performance for the prediction of MetS. Evidence suggests that more accurate diagnosis of MetS is required to evaluate the predictive performance of the statistical and ML techniques.",Downloaded successfully,/Volumes/Seagate_8TB/rxiv_072020/medrxiv.org/2020.06.01.20119339v1.pdf,Habeebah Adamu Kakudi; Chu Kiong Loo; Foong Ming Moy,,Habeebah Adamu Kakudi,,Foong Ming Moy,,

To evaluate the safety and efficacy of leflunomide for the treatment of refractory COVID-19 in adult patients.
DESIGN
Open-label controlled study 
SETTING
A designated hospital for patients with refractory COVID-19 in Wuhan, China.
PARTICIPANTS
27 hospitalized adult patients (≥18 years of age) with radiologically confirmed pneumonia and SARS-CoV-2 positive for more than 28 days despite standard care were assigned to receive standard of care (SOC, grp I) or leflunomide + SOC (grp 2). After 2 weeks, grp 1 and grp 2 patients who continued to be SARS-CoV-2-positive received leflunomide for 14 days while continuing SOC. 
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES
The primary outcomes were the rate of and time to SARS-CoV-2 clearance and the 14-day and 30-day hospital discharge rate. 
RESULTS
Twelve patients enrolled in grp 1 and 15 patients were in grp 2. The 14 days SARS-CoV-2 viral clearance rate was 80.0% (12/15) for grp 2 patients receiving leflunomide versus 16.7% for grp 1 patients (2/12) (P=0.002). By day 14, the median time to SARS-CoV-2 clearance was 6.0 days (range 1-12; IQR 1-12) for grp 2 patients. In grp 1, two patients converted to viral negative on days 1 and 6 (P=0.002). The 14-day discharge rate was 73.3% (11/15) for the grp 2 versus 8.3% (1/12) for grp 1 (P=0.001). The 30-day discharge rate was 100% (15/15) for the grp 2 versus 66.7% (8/12) for grp 1. No severe adverse events or deaths were reported.
CONCLUSION
Leflunomide is effective in enhancing SARS-CoV-2 clearance and hospital discharge in refractory COVID-19 patients. The addition of leflunomide to SOC did not increase adverse events versus SOC.

A Systematic Review and Narrative Synthesis of the Literature,5/28/20,"Objective: To assess the efficacy of heat thermotherapy to improve cardiovascular and cardiometabolic health, and to compare potential heat thermotherapy moderating factors. 
Design: Systematic review and narrative synthesis.
Data Sources: Electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE and Web of Science) were searched up to 6th February 2020.
Eligibility criteria for selecting studies: Journal articles with adult participants, a controlled trial study design, and a passive heating stimulus with a cardiovascular or cardiometabolic health outcome were included.
Results: From 1036 articles, 39 articles met the inclusion criteria. Heat thermotherapy was delivered acutely (one bout; n=19), short term (2-15 bouts; n=6) and chronically (>15 bouts; n=14), via either hot water immersion (n=26; water temperature 38-43 °C) or heated air exposure (n=11; air temperature 31-90 °C), or water perfused suit/handheld device (n=2). Heat exposure ranged from 10 to 240 minutes. Cardiovascular and cardiometabolic measurement techniques varied across studies, alongside participant age (≤35 years, n=376; >35 ≤60 years, n=335 and >60 years, n=350) and health status. 21/27 studies measuring cardiovascular outcomes reported positive health benefits, including increased flow-mediated dilation (1.3-5.3%) and lower systolic blood pressure (4-16 mm Hg). 15/22 studies measuring cardiometabolic outcomes reported positive health benefits, including reduced postprandial glucose (-0.89 to -0.5 mmol.L	-1) and C-reactive protein concentrations (-0.9 to -10.94 mg.L-1).

Introduction: Despite the new SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) be the seventh of the coronavirus family viruses known to cause human disease, little is known about potential symptoms and syndromes secondary to the compromise of the central and peripheral nervous systems. We reviewed neurological manifestations due to the new coronavirus, thus far published in the literature, as well as guidelines issued by sub-specialties in Neurology, to tackle the disease.

Methods: we searched medical databases, such as PubMed, PubMed Central, LILACS and Google scholar for papers (case reports, short letters, case series, etc) describing neurological symptoms in patients with confirmed or suspect COVID-19 diagnosis and also searched webpages of associations and organizations that deal with neurological disorders.

Results: we describe briefly each article considered for this review. Forty-one papers were found associating neurological conditions and COVID-19. Cases are divided by disease groups and, within each disease group, results are listed in chronological order or publication date. We also discuss briefly recommendations for neurological patients, according to disease group.

Conclusion: Although there is evidence of neurological manifestations with previous coronaviruses, COVID-19 is assuring a volume of published papers not seen before for other coronavirus infections. Most neurological cases are not life-threatening, but 10 to 20% of cases will require hospitalization and are in risk for sequelae and death. Although a lot of data coming from these papers is amassing, researchers must bear in mind that many papers currently published are not yet peer-reviewed, and thus are prone to further corrections.",Downloaded successfully,/Volumes/Seagate_8TB/rxiv_072020/medrxiv.org/2020.05.19.20107102v1.pdf,Paulo Afonso Mei; Laura Loeb,,Paulo Afonso Mei,,Laura Loeb,,

Design:  Systematic review

Data source: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, the Cochrane Library and Web of Science 
Study selection: Any design with animal or human models examining a currently prescribed UK drug compared to a control, placebo or sham group, and reporting an effect on ACE2 level, activity or gene expression.

Data extraction and synthesis: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, the Cochrane Library, Web of Science and OpenGrey from inception to 1st April 2020. Methodological quality was assessed using the SYRCLE's risk of bias tool for animal studies and Cochrane risk of bias tool for human studies.

Results: We screened 3,360 titles and included 112 studies with 21 different drug classes identified as influencing ACE2 activity. Ten studies were in humans and 102 were in animal models None examined ACE2 in human lungs. The most frequently examined drugs were Angiotensin Receptor Blockers (ARBs) (n= 55) and Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme- Inhibitors (ACE-I) (n= 22). More studies reported upregulation than downregulation with ACE-I (n=22), ARBs (n=55), insulin (n=8), thiazolidinedione (n=7) aldosterone agonists (n=3), statins (n=5), oestrogens (n=5) calcium channel-blockers (n=3) GLP-1 agonists (n=2) and NSAIDs (n=2). 

Conclusions: There is an abundance of academic literature and media reports on the potential of drugs that could attenuate or exacerbate COVID-19 disease. This is leading to trials of repurposed drugs and uncertainty amongst patients and clinicians concerning continuation or cessation of prescribed medications. Our review indicates that the impact of currently prescribed drugs on ACE2 has been poorly studied in-vivo, particularly in human lungs where the SARS-CoV-2 virus appears to enact its pathogenic effects. We found no convincing evidence to justify starting or stopping currently prescribed drugs to influence outcomes of COVID-19 disease.",Downloaded successfully,/Volumes/Seagate_8TB/rxiv_072020/medrxiv.org/2020.05.19.20106856v1.pdf,Hajira Dambha-Miller; Ali Albasri; Sam Hodgson; Christopher R Wilcox; Shareen Khan; Nazrul Nazrul Islam; Paul Little; Simon J Griffin,,Hajira Dambha-Miller,,Simon J Griffin,,

Purpose: To evaluate the diagnostic value of chest CT in 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), using the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction（RT-PCR）as a reference standard. At the same time, the imaging features of CT in confirmed COVID-19 patients would be summarized.
Methods: A comprehensive literature search of 5 electronic databases was performed. The pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were calculated using the random-effects model and the summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curve. We also conducted a meta-analysis to estimate the pooled incidence of the chest CT imaging findings and the 95% confidence interval (95%CI). Meta-regression analysis was used to explore the source of heterogeneity.
Results: Overall, 25 articles comprising 4,857 patients were included. The pooled sensitivity of CT was 93% (95% CI, 89-96%) and specificity was 44% (95% CI, 27-62%). The area under the SROC curve was 0.94 (95% CI, 0.91-0.96). For the RT-PCR assay, the pooled sensitivity of the initial test and the missed diagnosis rate after the second-round test were 76% (95% CI: 59-89%; I2=96%) and 26% (95% CI: 14-39%; I2=45%), respectively. According to the subgroup analysis, the diagnostic sensitivity of CT in Hubei was higher than that in other regions. Besides, the most common patterns on CT imaging finding was ground glass opacities (GGO) 58% (95% CI: 49-70%), followed by air bronchogram 51% (95% CI: 31-70%). Lesions were inclined to distribute in peripheral 64% (95% CI: 49-78%), and the incidence of bilateral lung involvement was 69% (95% CI: 58-79%).
Conclusions: There were still several cases of missed diagnosis after multiple RT-PCR examinations.

Methods: We performed a  cohort analysis of consecutive COVID-19 hospital admissions at 5 Johns Hopkins hospitals in the Baltimore/DC area between March 4 and April 24, 2020. Disease severity and outcomes were classified using the WHO COVID-19 disease severity ordinal scale. Cox proportional-hazards regressions were performed to assess relationships between demographics, clinical features and progression to severe disease or death.

Results: 832 COVID-19 patients were hospitalized; 633 (76.1%) were discharged, 113 (13.6%) died, and 85 (10.2%) remained hospitalized. Among those discharged, 518 (82%) had mild/moderate and 116 (18%) had severe illness. Mortality was statistically significantly associated with increasing age per 10 years (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 1.54; 95%CI 1.28-1.84), nursing home residence (aHR 2.13, 95%CI 1.41-3.23), Charlson comorbidity index (1.13; 95% CI 1.02-1.26), respiratory rate (aHR 1.13; 95%CI 1.09-1.17), D-dimer greater than 1mg/dL (aHR 2.79; 95% 1.53-5.09), and detectable troponin (aHR 2.79; 95%CI 1.53-5.09). In patients under 60, only male sex (aHR 1.7;95%CI 1.11-2.58), increasing body mass index (BMI) (aHR1.25 1.14-1.37), Charlson score (aHR 1.27; 1.1-1.46) and respiratory rate (aHR 1.16; 95%CI 1.13-1.2) were associated with severe illness or death.

Conclusions: A combination of demographic and clinical features on admission is strongly associated with progression to severe disease or death in a US cohort of COVID-19 patients. Younger patients have distinct risk factors for poor outcomes.  ",Downloaded successfully,/Volumes/Seagate_8TB/rxiv_072020/medrxiv.org/2020.05.24.20111864v1.pdf,Brian T Garibaldi; Jacob Fiksel; John Muschelli; Matthew L Robinson; Masoud Rouhizadeh; Paul Nagy; Josh H Gray; Harsha Malapati; Mariam Ghobadi-Krueger; Timothy M Niessen; Bo Soo Kim; Peter M Hill; M.

It has had a dramatic impact on society and world economies in only a few months. COVID-19 presents numerous challenges to all aspects of healthcare, including reliable methods for diagnosis, treatment, and prevention.  Initial efforts to contain the spread of the virus were hampered by the time required to develop reliable diagnostic methods. Artificial intelligence (AI) is a rapidly growing field of computer science with many applications to healthcare.  Machine learning is a subset of AI that employs deep learning with neural network algorithms. It can recognize patterns and achieve complex computational tasks often far quicker and with increased precision than humans.  In this manuscript, we explore the potential for a simple and widely available test as a chest x-ray (CXR) to be utilized with AI to diagnose COVID-19 reliably. Microsoft CustomVision is an automated image classification and object detection system that is a part of Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services.  We utilized publicly available CXR images for patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, pneumonia from other etiologies, and normal CXRs as a dataset to train Microsoft CustomVision.  Our trained model overall demonstrated 92.9% sensitivity (recall) and positive predictive value (precision), with results for each label showing sensitivity and positive predictive value at 94.8% and 98.9% for COVID-19 pneumonia, 89% and 91.8% for non-COVID-19 pneumonia, 95% and 88.8% for normal lung.  We then validated the program using CXRs of patients from our institution with confirmed COVID-19 diagnoses along with non-COVID-19 pneumonia and normal CXRs.  Our model performed with 100% sensitivity, 95% specificity, 97% accuracy, 91% positive predictive value, and 100% negative predictive value.

We construct an expertise-driven patient representation on top of their EHR data and apply a broad class of machine learning methods to predict several aspects of patient flows. 
Results: With a unique patient representation, we estimate short-term discharges, identify long-stay patients, predict discharge destination and anticipate flows in and out of intensive care units with accuracy in the 80%+ range. More importantly, we implement this machine learning pipeline into the EHR system of the hospital and construct prediction-informed dashboards to support daily bed placement decisions.

Methods 231 nurse practitioners were enrolled who worked in isolation region in designated hospitals to admit patients with COVID-19 in China. Demographic data, goggle-associated symptoms and underlying reasons, incidence of medical errors or exposures, the effects of fog in goggles on practice were all collected. Data were stratified and analyzed by age or working experience. Risk factors of goggle-associated medical errors were analyzed by multivariable logistical regression analysis. 
Findings Goggle-associated symptoms and foggy goggles widely presented in nurses. The most common symptoms were headache, skin pressure injury and dizziness. Headache, vomit and nausea were significantly fewer reported in nurses with longer working experience while rash occurred higher in this group. The underlying reasons included tightness of goggles, unsuitable design and uncomfortable materials. The working status of nurses with more working experience was less impacted by goggles. 11.3% nurses occurred medical exposures in clinical practice while 19.5% nurses made medical errors on patients. The risk factors for medical errors were time interval before adapting to goggle-associated discomforts, adjusting goggles and headache.
Interpretation Goggle-associated symptoms and fog can highly impact the working status and contribute to medical errors during management of COVID-19. Increased the experience with working in PPE through adequate training and psychological education may benefit for relieving some symptoms and improving working status.

Recently, IF1 was identified in systemic circulation in humans. IF1 appeared as an independent determinant of HDL-cholesterol with lower levels in coronary heart disease (CHD) patients. Moreover, IF1 was also found to negatively associate with mortality in these patients, supporting the notion that circulating IF1 could be a promising biomarker of cardiovascular disease. However, in previous studies, IF1 was quantified by a non-standardized competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Herein, we have validated a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method (LC-MS/MS) enabling the accurate quantification of IF1 in human plasma. Plasma IF1 was trypsin-digested through an optimized procedure before LC-MS/MS analysis. The method was successfully validated over 4 independent experiments into the range of 100-1,500 ng/mL. Intra- and inter-assay variation coefficients had never exceeded 14.2% and accuracy ranged between 95% and 102% for the selected EAGGAFGK peptide marker. Subsequently, the results of the LC-MS/MS method were compared with those obtained using ELISA in 204 individuals from the GENES study. We found that IF1 plasma levels obtained using both techniques were strongly correlated (r =0.89, p <0.0001), while the Bland-Altman plot did not indicate any major statistically significant differences. To clinically validate LC-MS/MS, we confirmed the positive correlation between IF1 plasma levels and HDL-cholesterol (r =0.38, p <0.0001). Besides, we found lower IF1 plasma levels in CHD patients compared to controls (431 +/- 132 ng/mL and 555 +/- 173 ng/mL, respectively; p <0.0001). Hence, it can be concluded that the presented LC-MS/MS method provides a highly specific strategy for IF1 quantification in human plasma and could be proposed as a reference technique.",Downloaded successfully,/Volumes/Seagate_8TB/rxiv_072020/medrxiv.org/2020.05.11.20097816v1.pdf,Annelise Genoux; Thibaut Duparc; Jean-Bernard Ruidavets; Cecile Ingueneau; Souad Najib; Jean Ferrieres; Bertrand Perret; Mikael Croyal; Laurent O Martinez,,Annelise Genoux,,Laurent O Martinez,,

Design: Observational, retrospective cohort study.

Setting: Nine-hospital health system within the Northeastern United States.

Populations: Adult patients (≥ 18 years) admitted from the emergency department who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2  (COVID-19) up to 24 hours after initial presentation. Patients meeting criteria for critical respiratory illness within 4 hours of arrival were excluded.

Main outcome and performance measures: We used a composite endpoint of respiratory critical illness as defined by oxygen requirement beyond low-flow nasal cannula (e.g., non-rebreather mask, high-flow nasal cannula, bi-level positive pressure ventilation), intubation, or death within the first 24 hours of hospitalization. We developed predictive models using patient demographic and clinical data collected during those first 4 hours. Eight hospitals were used for development and internal validation (n=932) and 1 hospital for model external validation (n=240). Predictive variables were identified using an ensemble approach that included univariate regression, random forest, logistic regression with LASSO, Chi-square testing, gradient boosting information gain, and gradient boosting Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) values prior to manual curation. We generated two predictive models, a quick COVID-19 severity index (qCSI) that uses only exam and vital sign measurements, and a COVID-19 severity index (CSI) machine learning model. Using area under receiver operating characteristic (AU-ROC), precision-recall curves (AU-PRC) and calibration metrics, we compare the qCSI and CSI to three illness scoring systems: Elixhauser mortality score, qSOFA, and CURB-65. We present performance of qCSI and CSI on an external validation cohort.

Results: During the study period from March 1, 2020 to April 27, 2020, 1,792 patients were admitted with COVID-19. Six-hundred and twenty patients were excluded based on age or critical illness within the first 4 hours, yielding 1172 patients in the final cohort. Of these patients, 144 (12.3%) met the composite endpoint within the first 24 hours. The qCSI (AU-ROC: 0.90 [0.85-0.96])  comprised of nasal cannula flow rate, respiratory rate, and minimum documented pulse oximetry outperformed the baseline models (qSOFA: 0.76 [0.69-0.85]; Elixhauser: 0.70 [0.62-0.80]; CURB-65: AU-ROC 0.66 [0.58-0.77]) and was validated on an external cohort (AU-ROC: 0.82). The machine learning-based CSI had superior performance on the training cohort (AU-ROC: 0.91 [0.86-0.97]), but was unlikely to provide practical improvements in clinical settings.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a novel coronavirus strain disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The disease is highly transmissible and severe disease including viral sepsis has been reported in up to 16% of hospitalized cases. The admission characteristics associated with increased odds of hospital mortality among confirmed cases of COVID-19 include severe hypoxia, low platelet count, elevated bilirubin, hypoalbuminemia and reduced glomerular filtration rate. These symptoms correlate highly with severe sepsis cases. The diseases also share similar co-morbidity risks including dementia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, coronary heart disease, hypertension and chronic renal failure. Sepsis has been observed in up to 59% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients.
It is highly desirable to identify risk factors and novel therapy/drug repurposing avenues for late-stage severe COVID-19 patients. This would enable better protection of at-risk populations and clinical stratification of COVID-19 patients according to their risk for developing life threatening disease.

METHODS
As there is currently insufficient data available for confirmed COVID-19 patients correlating their genomic profile, disease severity and outcome, co-morbidities and treatments as well as epidemiological risk factors (such as ethnicity, blood group, smoking, BMI etc.), a direct study of the impact of host genomics on disease severity and outcomes is not yet possible. We therefore ran a study on the UK Biobank sepsis cohort as a surrogate to identify sepsis associated signatures and genes, and correlated these with COVID-19 patients.
Sepsis is itself a life-threatening inflammatory health condition with a mortality rate of approximately 20%. Like the initial studies for COVID-19 patients, standard genome wide association studies (GWAS) have previously failed to identify more than a handful of genetic variants that predispose individuals to developing sepsis. 

RESULTS
We used a combinatorial association approach to analyze a sepsis population derived from UK Biobank. We identified 70 sepsis risk-associated genes, which provide insights into the disease mechanisms underlying sepsis pathogenesis. Many of these targets can be grouped by common mechanisms of action such as endothelial cell dysfunction, PI3K/mTOR pathway signaling, immune response regulation, aberrant GABA and neurogenic signaling.

CONCLUSION
This study has identified 70 sepsis related genes, many of them for the first time, that can reasonably be considered to be potentially relevant to severe COVID-19 patients. We have further identified 59 drug repurposing candidates for 13 of these targets that can be used for the development of novel therapeutic strategies to increase the survival rate of patients who develop sepsis and potentially severe COVID-19.",Downloaded successfully,/Volumes/Seagate_8TB/rxiv_072020/medrxiv.org/2020.05.05.20091918v1.pdf,Sayoni Das; Krystyna Taylor; Matthew Pearson; James Kozubek; Marcin Pawlowski; Claus Erik Jensen; Zbigniew Skowron; Gert Lykke Møller; Mark Strivens; Steve Gardner,,Sayoni Das,,Steve Gardner,,

To examine the safety profiles of these medications, we systematically evaluated the adverse events (AEs) of these medications from published randomized controlled trials (RCTs). 
Methods: We systematically searched PubMed, MEDLINE, Cochrane, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), EMBASE, and the ClinicalTrials.gov for all the RCTs comparing CQ or HCQ with placebo or other active agents, published before March 31, 2020. The random-effects or fixed-effects models were used to pool the risk estimates relative ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) for the outcomes.
Results: The literature search yielded 23 and 17 studies for CQ and HCQ, respectively, that satisfied our inclusion criteria. Of these studies, we performed meta-analysis on the ones that were placebo-controlled, which included 6 studies for CQ and 14 studies for HCQ. We did not limit our analysis to published reports involving viral treatment alone; data also included the usage of either CQ or HCQ for the treatment of other diseases. The trials for the CQ consisted of a total of 2,137 participants (n=1,077 CQ, n=1,060 placebo), while the trials for HCQ involved 1,096 participants (n=558 HCQ and n=538 placebo). The overall mild or total AEs were statistically higher comparing CQ or HCQ to placebo. The AEs were further categorized into four groups and analyses revealed that neurologic, gastrointestinal, dermatologic, and ophthalmic AEs were higher in participants taking CQ compared to placebo. Although this was not evident in HCQ treated groups, further analyses suggested that there were more AEs attributed to other organ system that were not included in the categorized meta-analyses. Additionally, meta-regression analyses revealed that total AEs was affected by dosage for the CQ group. 
Conclusions: Taken together, we found that participants taking either CQ or HCQ have more AEs than participants taking placebo.

Design: Retrospective manual medical record review.
Setting: NewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia University Irving Medical Center (NYP/CUIMC), a quaternary care academic medical center in NYC.
Participants: The first 1000 consecutive patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19.
Methods: We identified the first 1000 consecutive patients with a positive RT-SARS-CoV-2 PCR test who first presented to the ED or were hospitalized at NYP/CUIMC between March 1 and April 5, 2020. Patient data was manually abstracted from the electronic medical record.
Main outcome measures: We describe patient characteristics including demographics, presenting symptoms, comorbidities on presentation, hospital course, time to intubation, complications, mortality, and disposition.
Results: Among the first 1000 patients, 150 were ED patients, 614 were admitted without requiring ICU-level care, and 236 were admitted or transferred to the ICU. The most common presenting symptoms were cough (73.2%), fever (72.8%), and dyspnea (63.1%). Hospitalized patients, and ICU patients in particular, most commonly had baseline comorbidities including of hypertension, diabetes, and obesity. ICU patients were older, predominantly male (66.9%), and long lengths of stay (median 23 days; IQR 12 to 32 days); 78.0% developed AKI and 35.2% required dialysis. Notably, for patients who required mechanical ventilation, only 4.4% were first intubated more than 14 days after symptom onset. Time to intubation from symptom onset had a bimodal distribution, with modes at 3-4 and 9 days. As of April 30, 90 patients remained hospitalized and 211 had died in the hospital.

The 2019 novel Coronavirus (2019 nCoV), now declared a pandemic has an overall case fatality of 2 to 3% but it is as high as 50% in critically ill patients.  D-dimer is an important prognostic tool, often elevated in patients with severe COVID-19 infection and in those who suffered death.  In this systematic review, we aimed to investigate the prognostic role of D-dimer in COVID-19 infected patients. 
Methods. We searched PubMed, Medline, Embase, Ovid, and Cochrane for studies reporting admission D-dimer levels in COVID-19 patients and its effect on mortality. 
Results. 18 studies (16 retrospective and 2 prospective) with a total of 3,682 patients met the inclusion criteria. The pooled mean difference (MD) suggested significantly elevated D-dimer levels in patients who died versus those survived (MD 6.13 mg/L, 95% CI 4.16 to 8.11, p <0.001). Similarly, the pooled mean D-dimer levels were significantly elevated in patients with severe COVID-19 infection (MD 0.54 mg/L, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.8, p< 0.001).  In addition, the risk of mortality was four-fold higher in patients with positive D-dimer vs negative D-dimer (RR 4.11, 95% CI 2.48 to 6.84, p< 0.001) and the risk of developing the severe disease was two-fold higher in patients with positive D-dimer levels vs negative D-dimer (RR 2.04, 95% CI 1.34 to 3.11, p < 0.001).

The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 causing COVID-19 disease is yielding a global outbreak with serious threats to public health. In this paper, we aimed to review the current knowledge about COVID-19 infectious risk status in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients requiring immunosuppressive medication. Also, we focused on several molecular insights that could explain why IBD patients appear to not have higher risks of infection and worse outcome in COVID-19 than the general population, in attempt to provide scientific support for safer decisions in IBD patient care.
Methods.
PubMed electronic database was interogated for relevant articles involving data about common molecular pathways and shared treatment strategies between SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV and inflammatory bowel diseases. In addition, Neural Covidex, an artificial intelligence tool, was used to answer queries about pathogenic coronaviruses and possible IBD interactions using the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19). 
Discussions. 
Few molecular and therapeutic interactions between IBD and pathogenic coronaviruses were explored. First, we showed how the activity of soluble angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, CD209L alternate receptor and phosphorylated α subunit of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 might exert protective impact in IBD in case of coronavirus infection. Second, IBD medication was discussed in the context of possible beneficial effects on COVID-19 pathogeny including ""cytokine storm"" prevention and treatment, immunomodulation, interferon signaling blocking, viral endocytosis inhibition.
Conclusions.
Using current understanding of SARS-CoV-2 as well as other pathogenic coronaviruses immunopathology, we showed why IBD patients should not be considered at an increased risk of infection or more severe outcomes. Whether our findings are entirely applicable to the pathogenesis, disease susceptibility and treatment management of SARS-CoV-2 infection in IBD must be further explored.",Downloaded successfully,/Volumes/Seagate_8TB/rxiv_072020/medrxiv.org/2020.04.28.20082859v1.pdf,Iolanda Valentina Popa; Mircea Diculescu; Catalina Mihai; Cristina Cijevschi-Prelipcean; Alexandru Burlacu,,Iolanda Valentina Popa,,Alexandru Burlacu,,

Although more than 14,000 research articles on COVID-19 have been published with the disease taking a pandemic proportion, clinicians and researchers are struggling to distill knowledge for furthering clinical management and research. In this study, we address this gap for a targeted user group, i.e. clinicians, researchers, and policymakers by applying natural language processing to develop a CovidNLP dashboard in order to speed up knowledge discovery. The WHO has created a repository of about more than 5000 peer-reviewed and curated research articles on varied aspects including epidemiology, clinical features, diagnosis, treatment, social factors, and economics. We summarised all the articles in the WHO Database through an extractive summarizer followed by an exploration of the feature space using word embeddings which were then used to visualize the summarized associations of COVID-19 as found in the text. Clinicians, researchers, and policymakers will not only discover the direct effects of COVID-19 but also the systematic implications such as the anticipated rise in TB and cancer mortality due to the non-availability of drugs during the export lockdown as highlighted by our models. These demonstrate the utility of mining massive literature with natural language processing for rapid distillation and knowledge updates. This can help the users understand, synthesize, and take pre-emptive action with the available peer-reviewed evidence on COVID-19.

Hypertension is the most common pre-existing condition amongst COVID-19 patients.  Upregulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is common in hypertensive patients and may promote inflammation and ensuing cytokine storm in COVID-19.   It is unknown whether RAAS inhibition with ACE1 inhibitors or angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARB) can be harmful or beneficial.

Methods:  Within Hackensack Meridian Health network, the largest healthcare provider in New Jersey, we performed a retrospective, multicenter, convenience sampling study of hospitalized COVID-19 patients.   Demographics, clinical characteristics, treatments, and outcomes were manually abstracted.  Fishers exact tests, and logistic regression were performed.

Results:  Among 3017 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, 1584 (52.5%) carried a diagnosis of hypertension.  In the discharged or deceased cohort, the overall mortality was significantly increased at 35% vs 13% among COVID-19 patients with hypertension.  However, when adjusted for age, the effect of hypertension on mortality was greatly diminished, with a reduction in odds-ratio by over half; and completely disappeared when adjusted for other major covariates.  The mortality rates were lower for hypertensive patients prescribed ACE1 (27%, p=0.001) or ARBs (33%, p=0.12) compared to other anti-hypertensive agents (39%) in the unadjusted analyses.  RAAS inhibitor therapy appeared protective compared to other anti-hypertensive agents (p=0.001).

Conclusions:  While our results are limited by the retrospective nature of our study and by potential confounders, our data argue against a harmful effect of RAAS inhibition and support the HFSA/AHA/ACC joint statement recommending continuing ACE1 and ARB therapy in hypertensive COVID-19 patients.",Downloaded successfully,/Volumes/Seagate_8TB/rxiv_072020/medrxiv.org/2020.04.24.20077388v1.pdf,Andrew Ip; Kaushal Parikh; Joseph E Parrillo; Shivam Mathura; Eric Hansen; Ihor S Sawczuk; Stuart L Goldberg,,Andrew Ip,,Stuart L Goldberg,,

The accuracy of early diagnosis is critical in the control of the spread of the virus. Although the real-time RT-PCR detection of the virus nucleic acid is the current golden diagnostic standard, it has high false negative rate when only apply single test. 
 
Objective Summarize the baseline characteristics and laboratory examination results of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Analyze the factors that could interfere with the early diagnosis quantitatively to support the timely confirmation of the disease. 

Methods All suspected patients with COVID-19 were included in our study until Feb 9th, 2020. The last day of follow-up was Mar 20th, 2020. Throat swab real-time RT-PCR test was used to confirm SARS-CoV-2 infection. The difference between the epidemiological profile and first laboratory examination results of COVID-19 patients and non-COVID-19 patients were compared and analyzed by multiple logistic regression. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and area under curve (AUC) were used to assess the potential diagnostic value in factors, which had statistical differences in regression analysis.

Results In total, 315 hospitalized patients were included. Among them, 108 were confirmed as COVID-19 patients and 207 were non-COVID-19 patients. Two groups of patients have significance in comparing age, contact history, leukocyte count, lymphocyte count, C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (p<0.10). Multiple logistic regression analysis showed age, contact history and decreasing lymphocyte count could be used as individual factor that has diagnostic value (p<0.05). The AUC of first RT-PCR test was 0.84 (95% CI 0.73-0.89), AUC of cumulative two times of RT-PCR tests was 0.92 (95% CI 0.88-0.96) and 0.96 (95% CI 0.93-0.99) for cumulative three times of RT-PCR tests. Ninety-six patients showed typical pneumonia radiological features in first CT scan, AUC was 0.74 (95% CI 0.60-0.73). The AUC of patients age, contact history with confirmed people and the decreased lymphocytes were 0.66 (95% CI 0.60-0.73), 0.67 (95% CI 0.61-0.73), 0.62 (95% CI 0.56-0.69), respectively. Taking chest CT scan diagnosis together with patients age and decreasing lymphocytes, AUC would be 0.86 (95% CI 0.82-0.90). The age threshold to predict COVID-19 was 41.5 years, with a diagnostic sensitivity of 0.70 (95% CI 0.61-0.79) and a specificity of 0.59 (95% CI 0.52-0.66). Positive and negative likelihood ratios were 1.71 and 0.50, respectively. Threshold of lymphocyte count to diagnose COVID-19 was 1.53x109/L, with a diagnostic sensitivity of 0.82 (95% CI 0.73-0.88) and a specificity of 0.50 (95% CI 0.43-0.57). Positive and negative likelihood ratios were 1.64 and 0.37, respectively.

Conclusion Single RT-PCR test has relatively high false negative rate.

outcomes among hospitalized patients with Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) in the US are
unknown.

Objectives: To describe the degree of myocardial injury and associated outcomes in a large
hospitalized cohort with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19.

Methods: Patients with COVID-19 admitted to one of five Mount Sinai Health System hospitals
in New York City between February 27th and April 12th, 2020 with troponin-I (normal value
<0.03ng/mL) measured within 24 hours of admission were included (n=2,736). Demographics,
medical history, admission labs, and outcomes were captured from the hospital EHR.

Results: The median age was 66.4 years, with 59.6% men. Cardiovascular disease (CVD)
including coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and heart failure, was more prevalent in patients with higher troponin concentrations, as were hypertension and diabetes. A total of 506
(18.5%) patients died during hospitalization. Even small amounts of myocardial injury (e.g.
troponin I 0.03-0.09ng/mL, n=455, 16.6%) were associated with death (adjusted HR: 1.77, 95%

Conclusions: Myocardial injury is prevalent among patients hospitalized with COVID-19, and is
associated with higher risk of mortality. Patients with CVD are more likely to have myocardial
injury than patients without CVD. Troponin elevation likely reflects non-ischemic or secondary
myocardial injury.",Downloaded successfully,/Volumes/Seagate_8TB/rxiv_072020/medrxiv.org/2020.04.20.20072702v2.pdf,Anuradha Lala; Kipp W Johnson; Adam J Russak; Ishan Paranjpe; Shan Zhao; Sulaiman Solani; Akhil Vaid; Fayzan Chaudhry; Jessica K De Freitas; Zahi A Fayad; Sean P Pinney; Matthew Levin; Alexander Charney; Emilia Bagiella; Jagat Narula; Benjamin S Glicksberg; Girish Nadkarni; James Januzzi; Donna M Mancini; Valentin Fuster,,Anuradha Lala,,Valentin Fuster,,

Data on the epidemiology, clinical course, and outcomes of critically ill patients with COVID-19 in this setting are needed. 

Methods: We prospectively collected clinical, biomarker, and treatment data on critically ill adults with laboratory-confirmed-COVID-19 admitted to two hospitals in northern Manhattan between March 2nd and April 1st, 2020. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included frequency and duration of invasive mechanical ventilation, frequency of vasopressor use and renal-replacement-therapy, and time to clinical deterioration following hospital admission. The relationship between clinical risk factors, biomarkers, and in-hospital mortality was modeled using Cox-proportional-hazards regression. Each patient had at least 14 days of observation. 

Results: Of 1,150 adults hospitalized with COVID-19 during the study period, 257 (22%) were critically ill. The median age was 62 years (interquartile range [IQR] 51-72); 170 (66%) were male. Two-hundred twelve (82%) had at least one chronic illness, the most common of which were hypertension (63%; 162/257) and diabetes mellitus (36%; 92/257). One-hundred-thirty-eight patients (54%) were obese, and 13 (5%) were healthcare workers. As of April 14th, 2020, in-hospital mortality was 33% (86/257); 47% (122/257) of patients remained hospitalized. Two-hundred-one (79%) patients received invasive mechanical ventilation (median 13 days [IQR 9-17]), and 54% (138/257) and 29% (75/257) required vasopressors and renal-replacement-therapy, respectively. The median time to clinical deterioration following hospital admission was 3 days (IQR 1-6). Older age, hypertension, chronic lung disease, and higher concentrations of interleukin-6 and d-dimer at admission were independently associated with in-hospital mortality.

Emerging evidence suggests that a subset of COVID-19 is characterized by the development of a cytokine storm syndrome (CSS), and interleukin (IL)-6 levels are predictors of COVID-19 severity and in-hospital mortality. Targeting hyper-inflammation in COVID-19 may be critical for reducing mortality. 

Catecholamines enhance inflammatory injury by augmenting the production of IL-6 and other cytokines through a self-amplifying feed-forward loop in immune cells that requires alpha-1 adrenergic receptor (α1-AR) signaling. Prophylactic inhibition of catecholamine synthesis with the α1-AR antagonist prazosin reduced catecholamines and cytokine responses in mice, and resulted in markedly increased survival following various hyper-inflammatory stimuli. These findings offer a rationale for studying α1-AR antagonists in the prophylaxis of patients with COVID-19-CSS and ARDS. 

As high infection rates threaten to overwhelm hospital capacity during this pandemic, preventative approaches that ameliorate COVID-19 severity and reduce excessive mortality are desperately needed. We hypothesize that treatment with prazosin of individuals who test positive for SARS-CoV-2 could reduce catecholamine surges, secondary cytokine dysregulation, and mortality. 

To investigate a potential role for α1-AR antagonists in preventing poor outcomes in ARDS, we conducted a retrospective analysis of hospitalized patients diagnosed with ARDS. Using data from the Truven Health MarketScan Research Database (2010-2017), we identified 13,125 men (age 45-64) with ARDS, of whom 655 patients (5.0%) were prescribed α1-AR antagonists in the previous year. Applying logistic regression models, we found that patients with prior use of α1-AR antagonists had lower odds of invasive mechanical ventilation compared to non-users (adjusted OR=0.75, 95% CI 0.59-0.95, p=0.019). Perhaps more importantly, those patients had a ~36% lower incidence of both being ventilated and dying in the hospital (adjusted OR=0.59, 95% CI 0.34-0.95, p=0.042). By contrast, prior use of beta-adrenergic receptor (β-AR) antagonists was not correlated with either outcome. We extended these analyses to patients admitted with pneumonia. Of 108,956 subjects in this cohort, 5,498 patients (5.0%) were taking α1-AR antagonist. Similar to ARDS, patients with pneumonia on α1-AR antagonists (but no β-AR antagonists) had a lower odds of mechanical ventilation (adjusted OR=0.83, 95% CI 0.75-0.92, p<0.001) and of both being ventilated and dying in the hospital (adjusted OR=0.77, 95% CI 0.62-0.94, p=0.014) compared to non-users. Mirroring findings from pre-clinical models, these data support a clinical rationale to study α1-AR antagonists in the prevention of severe complications of pneumonia, ARDS, and COVID-19. 

Prospective, randomized clinical trials of alpha-1 receptor antagonists (e.g. prazosin) administered prior to the onset of severe symptoms are needed to assess their efficacy in preventing CSS and reducing mortality in COVID-19.",Downloaded successfully,/Volumes/Seagate_8TB/rxiv_072020/medrxiv.org/2020.04.02.20051565v2.pdf,Maximilian F Konig; Mike Powell; Verena Staedtke; Ren-Yuan Bai; David L Thomas; Nicole Fischer; Sakibul Huq; Adham M Khalafallah; Allison Koenecke; Ruoxuan Xiong; Brett Mensh; Nickolas Papadopoulos; Kenneth W Kinzler; Bert Vogelstein; Joshua T Vogelstein; Susan Athey; Shibin Zhou; Chetan Bettegowda,,Maximilian F Konig,,Chetan Bettegowda,,

As with any public health emergency, a major component of the global response is timely, effective science. However, particular factors specific to COVID-19 must be overcome to ensure that research efforts are optimised. We aimed to model the impact of COVID-19 on the clinical academic response in the UK, and to provide recommendations for COVID-related research.  

Methods: We constructed a simple stochastic model to determine clinical academic capacity in the UK in four policy approaches to COVID-19 with differing population infection rates: Italy model (6%), mitigation (10%), relaxed mitigation (40%) and do-nothing (80%) scenarios. The ability to conduct research in the COVID-19 climate is affected by the following key factors: (i) infection growth rate and population infection rate (from UK COVID-19 statistics and WHO); (ii) strain on the healthcare system (from published model); and (iii) availability of clinical academic staff with appropriate skillsets affected by frontline clinical activity and sickness (from UK statistics).  

Findings: In Italy model, mitigation, relaxed mitigation and do-nothing scenarios, from 5 March 2020 the duration (days) and peak infection rates (%) are 95(2.4%), 115(2.5%), 240(5.3%) and 240(16.7%) respectively. Near complete attrition of academia (87% reduction, less than 400 clinical academics) occurs 35 days after pandemic start for 11, 34, 62, 76 days respectively, with no clinical academics at all for 37 days in the do-nothing scenario. Restoration of normal academic workforce (80% of normal capacity) takes 11,12, 30 and 26 weeks respectively.

Interpretation: Pandemic COVID-19 crushes the science needed at system level. National policies mitigate, but the academic community needs to adapt. We highlight six key strategies: radical prioritisation (eg 3-4 research ideas per institution), deep resourcing, non-standard leadership (repurposing of key non-frontline teams), rationalisation (profoundly simple approaches), careful site selection (eg protected sites with large academic backup) and complete suspension of academic competition with collaborative approaches.",Downloaded successfully,/Volumes/Seagate_8TB/rxiv_072020/medrxiv.org/2020.04.14.20065417v1.pdf,Amitava Banerjee; Michail Katsoulis; Alvina G Lai; Laura Pasea; Thomas A Treibel; Charlotte Manisty; Spiros Denaxas; Giovanni Quarta; Harry Hemingway; Joao Cavalcante; Mahdad Nousardeghi; James C Moon,,Amitava Banerjee,,James C Moon,,

The anticipated spread of the virus requires an urgent appraisal of the capacity of US healthcare services and the identification of states most vulnerable to exceeding their capacity

Methods: In the American Hospital Association survey for 2018, a database of US community hospitals, we identified total inpatient beds, adult intensive care unit (ICU) beds, and airborne isolation rooms across all hospitals in each state of continental US. The burden of COVID-19 hospitalizations was estimated based on a median hospitalization duration of 12 days and was evaluated for a 30-day reporting period. 

Results: At 5155 US community hospitals across 48 states in the contiguous US and Washington DC, there were a total of 788,032 inpatient beds, 68,280 adult ICU beds, and 44,222 isolation rooms. The median daily bed occupancy was 62.8% (IQR 58.1%, 66.6%) across states. Nationally, for every 10,000 individuals, there are 24.2 inpatient beds, 2.8 adult ICU beds, and 1.4 isolation beds.  There is a 3-fold variation in the number of inpatient beds available across the US, ranging from 16.4 per 10,000 in Oregon to 47 per 10,000 in South Dakota. There was also a similar 3-fold variation in available or non-occupied beds, ranging from 4.7 per 10,000 in Connecticut through 18.3 per 10,000 in North Dakota. The availability of ICU beds is low nationally, ranging from 1.4 per 10,000 in Nevada to 4.7 per 10000 in Washington DC.
Hospitalizations for COVID-19 in a median 0.2% (IQR 0.2 %, 0.3%) of state population, or 1.4% of state's older adults (1.0%, 1.9%) will require all non-occupied beds. Further, a median 0.6% (0.5%, 0.8%) of state population, or 3.9% (3.1%, 4.6%) of older individuals would require 100% of inpatient beds.

The extent to which these indices are influenced by factors other than vascular health remains a matter of concern. In this paper, we will first derive a mathematical model for the reflection time (Trefl), and the augmentation index (AI), assuming a general extended model of the arterial system. Then, we test our model against values reported in the literature. Finally, we discuss insights from the model to common observations in the literature such as age-related ""shift"" in the reflection site, the variation of AI with heart rate, and the flattening of Trefl in older participants. Our results indicate that although both Trefl and AI are affected by aging, the load properties are important factors to consider. Especially for Trefl, the delay caused at the load site can account for more than 50% of its value. The comparison between model outputs and reported values confirms the validity of the model.

To address the potential impact of excluding physicians with a high risk of adverse outcomes based on age, we evaluated the current patterns of age of licensed physicians across the United States.

Methods: We compiled information from the 2018 database of actively licensed physicians in the Federation of State Medical Boards (FSMB) across the US. Both at a national- and the state-level, we assessed the number and proportion of physicians who would be at an elevated risk due to age over 60 years.

Results: Of the 985,026 licensed physicians in the US, 235857 or 23.9% were aged 25-40 years, 447052 or 45.4% are 40-60 years, 191794 or 19.5% were 60-70 years, and 106121 or 10.8% were 70 years or older. Age was not reported in 4202 or 0.4% of physicians. Overall, 297915 or 30.2% of physicians were 60 years of age or older, 246167 (25.0%) 65 years and older, and 106121 (10.8%) 70 years or older. States in the US reported that a median 5470 licensed physicians (interquartile range [IQR], 2394 to 10108) were 60 years of age or older. Notably, states of North Dakota (n=1180) and Vermont (n = 1215) had the lowest and California (n=50786) and New York (n=31582) the highest number of physicians over the age of 60 years (Figure 1). Across states, the median proportion of physicians aged 60 years and older was 28.9% (IQR, 27.2%, 31.4%), and ranged between 25.9% for Nebraska to 32.6% for New Mexico (Figure 2).

Discussion: Older physicians represent a large proportion of the US physician workforce, particularly in states with the worst COVID-19 outbreak. Therefore, their exclusion from patient care will be impractical.

Methods: Body mass index (BMI) was measured at age 11 in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children. Left ventricular mass indexed to height2.7 (LVMI), was assessed by echocardiography at age 17. The metabolic profile was quantified via nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy at age 15. 
Multivariable confounder (maternal age, parity, highest qualification, maternal smoking, pre-pregnancy BMI, pre-pregnancy height, household social class and adolescent birthweight, adolescent smoking, fruit and vegetable consumption, physical activity) -adjusted linear regression estimated the association of BMI with LVMI and mediation by metabolic traits. We considered 156 metabolomic traits individually, jointly as principal components (PCs) explaining 95% of the variance in the NMR platform, and assessed whether the PCs for the metabolic traits added to the proportion of the association explained by established cardiovascular risk factors (systolic and diastolic blood pressure, insulin, triglycerides, low density lipoprotein, and glucose).
Results: A 1kg/m2 higher BMI was associated with a 0.70 g/m2.7 (0.53, 0.88) and 0.66 g/m2.7 (0.53, 0.79) higher LVMI in males (N=437) and females (N=536), respectively.

BACKGROUND During epidemic period, chest computed tomography (CT) has been highly recommended for screening patients with suspected COVID-19. However, the comparison of CT imaging between heart failure and COVID-19 pneumonia has not been fully elucidated.
METHODS Patients with heart failure (n=12), COVID-19 pneumonia (n=12) and one patient with both diseases were retrospectively enrolled. Clinical information and imaging of chest CT were collected and analyzed. 
RESULTS There was no difference of ground glass opacity (GGO), consolidation, crazy paving pattern, lobes affected and septal thickening between heart failure and COVID-19 pneumonia. However, less rounded morphology (8.3% vs. 67%, p=0.003), more peribronchovascular thickening (75% vs. 33%, p=0.041) and fissural thickening (33% vs. 0%, p=0.028), less peripheral distribution (33% vs. 92%, p=0.003) were found in heart failure group than that in COVID-19 group.

An agnostic statistical framework using Bayesian model averaging (MR-BMA) can disentangle the causal role of correlated risk factors with shared genetic predictors. Here, our objective is to identify lipoprotein measures as mediators between lipid-associated genetic variants and coronary artery disease (CAD) for the purpose of detecting therapeutic targets for CAD.

Methods: As risk factors we consider 30 lipoprotein measures and metabolites derived from a high-throughput metabolomics study including 24,925 participants. We fit multivariable MR models of genetic associations with CAD estimated in 453,595 participants (including 113,937 cases) regressed on genetic associations with the risk factors. MR-BMA assigns to each combination of risk factors a model score quantifying how well the genetic associations with CAD are explained. Risk factors are ranked by their marginal score and selected using false discovery rate (FDR) criteria. We perform sensitivity and replication analyses varying the dataset for genetic associations with CAD.

Results: In the main analysis, the top combination of risk factors ranked by the model score contains apolipoprotein B (ApoB) only. ApoB is also the highest ranked risk factor with respect to the marginal score (FDR< 0.005). Additionally, ApoB is selected in all replication analyses. No other measure of cholesterol or triglyceride is consistently selected otherwise. 

Conclusions: Our agnostic genetic investigation prioritizes ApoB across all datasets con- sidered, suggesting that ApoB, representing the total number of hepatic-derived lipoprotein particles, is the primary lipid determinant of CAD.",Downloaded successfully,/Volumes/Seagate_8TB/rxiv_072020/medrxiv.org/2020.02.10.20021691v1.pdf,Verena Zuber; Dipender Gill; Mika Ala-Korpela; Claudia Langenberg; Adam Butterworth; Leonardo Bottolo; Stephen Burgess,,Verena Zuber,,Stephen Burgess,,

We aimed to propose a deep learning-based algorithm and a practical strategy to better stratify the risk of pulmonary nodules, thus reducing medical errors and optimizing the clinical workflow.

Materials and Methods: A total of 2,348 pulmonary nodules (1,215 with lung cancer) containing screened nodules from National Lung Cancer Screening Trial (NLST) and incidentally detected nodules from Jinling Hospital (JLH) were used to train and evaluate a deep learning algorithm, Filter-guided pyramid network (FGP-NET). Internal and external test of FGP-NET were performed on two independent datasets (n=542). The performance of FGP-NET at Youden point which maximizing the Youden index was compared with 126 board-certificated radiologists. We further proposed Hierarchical Ordered Network ORiented Strategy (HONORS), which manipulates the emphasis either on sensitivity or specificity to target risk-stratified clinical scenarios, directly making decisions for some patients.

Results: FGP-NET achieved a high area under the curve (AUC) of 0.969 and 0.855 for internal and external testing, and was comparable or even outperformed the radiologists when considering sensitivity. HONORS-guided FGP-NET identified benign nodules with a high sensitivity (95.5%) in the screening scenario, and demonstrated satisfactory performance for the rest ambiguous nodules with 0.945 of AUC by the Youden point. FGP-NET also detected lung cancer with a high specificity of 94.5% in routine diagnostic scenario; an AUC of 0.809 was achieved for the rest nodules.

Conclusion: The combination of HONORS and FGP-NET provides well-organized stratification for pulmonary nodules and also offers the potential for reducing medical errors.",Downloaded successfully,/Volumes/Seagate_8TB/rxiv_072020/medrxiv.org/2020.02.03.20020297v1.pdf,Wenhui Lv; Yang Wang; Changsheng Zhou; Sheng Huang; Xiangming Fang; Qiuzhen Xu; Qirui Zhang; Chuxi Huang; Xinyu Li; Zhen Zhou; Yizhou Yu; Yizhou Wang; Mengjie Lu; Qiang Xu; Xiuli Li; Haoliang Lin; Xiaofan Lu; Qinmei Xu; Jing Sun; Yuxia Tang; Yong Song; Fangrong Yan; Bing Zhang; Zhen Cheng; Longjiang Zhang; Guangming Lu,,Wenhui Lv,,Guangming Lu,,

Thermal protection of the esophageal lumen by infusing cold liquid can reduce thermal injury to a limited extent. 

Objective: To investigate the ability of a powerful temperature control device to protect the esophagus from ablation-related thermal injury.

Methods: A single-center, prospective, double-blinded randomized controlled trial was used to investigate the ability of the ensoETM device to protect the esophagus from thermal injury. This method was compared in a 1:1 randomization to a control group of standard practice utilizing a single-point temperature probe. In the study group, the device was used to keep the luminal temperature at 4 degrees during radiofrequency (RF) ablation for AF. Endoscopic examination was performed at 7 days post-ablation and esophageal injury was scored. The patient and the endoscopist were blinded to the randomization.

Results: We recruited 188 patients, of whom 120 underwent endoscopy. Thermal injury to the mucosa was significantly more common in the control group than in those receiving esophageal protection (12/60 versus 2/60; P=0.008), with a trend toward reduction in gastroparesis (6/60 Vs 2/60, p=0.27). There was no difference between groups in RF duration, force, power and combined ablation index (P value range= 0.2-0.9). Procedure duration and fluoroscopy duration were similar (P=0.97, P=0.91 respectively). 

Conclusion: Thermal protection of the esophageal lumen significantly reduces ablation-related thermal injury compared to standard care.

However, blood pressure control rate is still poor with antihypertensive drugs use. Although Clinical Prediction Rules (CPR) is useful to help clinicians make more appropriate decisions at the point of medication, the evidence is still limited in china. The objective of this study is to develop an CPR of antihypertensive drugs in individualized application of patients based on real-world practice.
Methods:  A two-way cohort study has been conducted in one China's large tertiary hospital using clinical information on patient characteristics, drug use and clinical outcome. Data extraction is through ICD-10 disease codes of hypertension from Electronic Medical Record System. Eligible patients admitted from September 2016 to August 2018 who have received at least one antihypertensive drug therapy is included. Patients were grouped into several exposure groups according to medications. COX regression model and clinical specialty survey is applied to identify Influencing Factors (IF) in different study groups, and the discriminant model was used to construct a CPR according IF. The accuracy of the CPR is analyzed by sensitivity, specificity, Youden's index and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve.
Discussion: Result is expected to provide valuable CPR for physicians and policymakers with respect to treating hypertension according characteristic of individual patients. By developing a predictive method for clinical outcomes and treatment costs of antihypertensive medication, we expect to discriminate those patients who would profit from specific scheme of antihypertensive drugs to minimal incidence probability of costs and complications in region of china.

Restored kidney function through transplantation reduces left ventricular volume in both systole and diastole.  Paraoxonase 1 (PON1) is reduced in patients on dialysis, which may be related to their impaired cardiac function.  We tested the hypothesis that change in PON1 is associated with changes in left ventricular (LV) end-volume and LV mass after kidney transplantation.
Methods: Patients were studied before and 12 months after kidney transplantation.  The control group was patients on dialysis not expected to receive a transplant in the next 12 months.  Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging was used to measure LV end-diastolic and end-systolic volume and LV mass.  PON1 was measured by arylesterase activity and by mass.
Results:  PON1 mass and activity were not different between the groups at baseline.  Both PON1 mass and activity were increased post-kidney transplantation (p<0.0001 for change).  The change in PON1 mass (p=0.0062) and PON1 arylesterase activity (p=0.0254) were inversely correlated with the change in NT-proBNP for patients receiving a kidney transplant.  However, only the change in the PON1 mass, but not the change in PON1 arylesterase, was inversely correlated with the change in left ventricular volume (ml/m2.7) (p=0.0146 and 0.0114 for diastolic and systolic, respectively) and with the change in hemoglobin (p=0.0042).  
Conclusions: PON1 mass and activity increase after kidney transplantation.

Prospective evaluation with repeated human measurements confirms that our model has less variance than experts. By leveraging information across multiple cardiac cycles, our model can identify subtle changes in ejection fraction, is more reproducible than human evaluation, and lays the foundation for precise diagnosis of cardiovascular disease.

Monthly slope-change models identified an increase in mortality for HF and pneumonia in the pre-HRRP period (P<.001 for slope-change). The changes in average mortality across the four time periods model found an increase in mortality for HF and pneumonia in the HRRP anticipation period (post-announcement, pre-implementation) as well as following HRRP implementation.

Background: Concern has been raised about consequences of including patients with left ventricular assist device (LVAD) or heart transplantation (HT) in readmission and mortality measures.
Methods: We calculated unadjusted and hospital-specific 30-day risk-standardized mortality (RSMR) and readmission (RSRR) rates for all Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries with a primary diagnosis of AMI or HF discharged between July 2010 and June 2013. Hospitals were compared before and after excluding LVAD and HT patients. LVAD indication was measured.
Results:
For the AMI and HF cohorts, <0.2% of patients received an LVAD and <0.1% received HT in either cohort. Less than 2% of hospitals had either >6 patients who received an LVAD or, independently, had >1 HT. The AMI mortality and readmission cohorts used 1.8% and 2.8% of LVADs for semi-permanent/permanent indications, versus 73.8% and 78.0% for HF patients, respectively. The rest were for temporary/external indications.
In the AMI cohort, RSMR for hospitals without LVAD patients versus hospitals with >6 LVADs was 14.8% and 14.3%, and RSRR was 17.8% and 18.3%, respectively; the HF cohort RSMR was 11.9% and 9.7% and RSRR was 22.6% and 23.4%, respectively. In the AMI cohort, RSMR for hospitals without versus with HT patients was 14.7% and 13.9% and RSRR was 17.8% and 17.7%, respectively; in the HF cohort, RSMR was 11.9% and 11.0%, and RSRR was 22.6% and 22.6%, respectively. Estimations changed <0.1% after excluding LVAD or HT patients.
Conclusion: 
Hospitals caring for >6 patients with LVAD or >1 HT had lower RSMRs but higher RSRRs on average. Rates were insignificantly changed when these patients were excluded. LVADs were primarily for acute-care in the AMI cohort and chronic support in the HF cohort. LVAD and HT patients are a distinct group with differential care requirements and outcomes, thus should be considered separately from the rest of the HF cohort.",Downloaded successfully,/Volumes/Seagate_8TB/rxiv_072020/medrxiv.org/19011213v1.pdf,Eric J Brandt; Joseph S.

Over a median follow-up of 24.4 years, SCD incidence was higher in black (2.86; 95%CI 2.50-3.28 per 1000 person-years) than white participants (1.37; 95%CI 1.22-1.53 per 1000 person-years). Black participants with hypertension had the highest rate of SCD: 4.26; 95%CI 3.66-4.96 per 1000 person-years. Race did not modify associations of EP substrate with SCD and nonSCD.

Identifying eligible trial participants is a resource-intensive task when relying on manual review of clinical notes, particularly in critical care settings where the time window is short. Automated review of electronic health records has been explored as a way of identifying trial participants, but much of the information is in unstructured free text rather than a computable form. We developed an electronic health record pipeline that combines structured electronic health record data with free text in order to simulate recruitment into the LeoPARDS trial. We applied an algorithm to identify eligible patients using a moving 1-hour time window, and compared the set of patients identified by our approach with those actually screened and recruited for the trial. We manually reviewed clinical records for a random sample of additional patients identified by the algorithm but not identified for screening in the original trial. Our approach identified 308 patients, of whom 208 were screened in the actual trial. We identified all 40 patients with CCHIC data available who were actually recruited to LeoPARDS in our centre. The algorithm identified 96 patients on the same day as manual screening and 62 patients one or two days earlier. Analysis of electronic health records incorporating natural language processing tools could effectively replicate recruitment in a critical care trial, and identify some eligible patients at an earlier stage. If implemented in real-time this could improve the efficiency of clinical trial recruitment.",Downloaded successfully,/Volumes/Seagate_8TB/rxiv_072020/medrxiv.org/19005603v2.pdf,Hegler Tissot; Anoop Shah; Ruth Agbakoba; Amos Folarin; Luis Romao; David Brealey; Steve Harris; Lucasz Roguski; Richard Dobson; Folkert Asselbergs,,Hegler Tissot,,Folkert Asselbergs,,

A causative role for plasmin(ogen) as a “second hit” in kidney disease progression has yet to be demonstrated in vivo, and the association between plasmin(ogen)uria and kidney function in glomerular diseases remains unclear. We performed comparative studies in a puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN) nephropathy rat model treated with amiloride, an inhibitor of plasminogen activation, and measured changes in plasmin(ogen)uria and urinary endothelin-1 (ET1). In a glomerular disease biorepository cohort (n=128), we measured time-of- biopsy albuminuria, proteinuria, and plasmin(ogen)uria for correlations with renal outcomes. Increased glomerular plasmin(ogen) was found in PAN rats and FSGS patients. PAN nephropathy was associated with increases in plasmin(ogen)uria, proteinuria, and urinary ET1. Amiloride was protective against PAN- induced glomerular injury, reducing urinary ET1 and oxidative stress. In patients, we found associations between plasmin(ogen)uria and edema status as well as eGFR. Our study demonstrates a role for plasmin(ogen)-induced podocyte injury in the PAN nephropathy model, with amiloride having podocyte- protective properties. In one of largest glomerular disease cohorts to study plasminogen, we validated previous findings while suggesting a potentially novel relationship between plasmin(ogen)uria and eGFR. Together, these findings suggest a role for plasmin(ogen) in mediating glomerular injury and as a viable targetable biomarker for podocyte-sparing treatments.",Downloaded successfully,/Volumes/Seagate_8TB/rxiv_072020/medrxiv.org/19006809v1.pdf,Marc A Egerman; Jenny S Wong; Tian Runxia; Gohar Mosoyan; Kinsuk Chauhan; Fadi El Salem; Kristin Meliambro; Hong Li; Evren Azeloglu; Steven Coca; Kirk N Campbell; Leopoldo Raij,,Marc A Egerman,,Leopoldo Raij,,

However, the precise way in which one or more lipoprotein lipid-related entities account for this relationship remains unclear. We sought to explore the causal relationships of blood lipid traits with risk of CHD using multivariable Mendelian randomization.

Methods: We conducted GWAS of circulating blood lipid traits in UK Biobank (up to n=440,546) for LDL cholesterol, triglycerides and apolipoprotein B to identify lipid-associated SNPs. Using data from CARDIoGRAMplusC4D for CHD (consisting of 60,801 cases and 123,504 controls), we performed univariable and multivariable Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses. Similar analyses were conducted for HDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein A-I.

Findings: GWAS identified multiple independent SNPs associated at P<5x10-8 for LDL cholesterol (220), apolipoprotein B (n=255), triglycerides (440), HDL cholesterol (534) and apolipoprotein AI (440). Between 56-93% of SNPs identified for each lipid trait had not been previously reported in large-scale GWAS. Almost half (46%) of these SNPs were associated at P<5x10-8 with more than one lipid related trait. Assessed individually using MR, each of LDL cholesterol (OR 1.66 per 1 standard deviation higher trait; 95%CI: 1.49; 1.86; P=2.4x10-19), triglycerides (OR 1.34; 95%CI: 1.25, 1.44; P=9.1x10-16) and apolipoprotein B (OR 1.73; 95%CI: 1.56, 1.91; P=1.5x10-25) had effect estimates consistent with a higher risk of CHD. In multivariable MR, only apolipoprotein B (OR 1.92; 95%CI: 1.31, 2.81; P=7.5x10-4) retained a robust effect with the estimate for LDL cholesterol (OR 0.85; 95%CI: 0.57; 1.27; P=0.44) reversing and that of triglycerides (OR 1.12; 95%CI: 1.02, 1.23; P=0.01) becoming markedly weaker.
Individual MR analyses showed a 1-SD higher HDL-C (OR 0.80; 95%CI: 0.75, 0.86; P=1.7x10-10) and apolipoprotein A-I (OR 0.83; 95%CI: 0.77, 0.89; P=1.0x10-6) to lower the risk of CHD but these effect estimates weakened to include the null on accounting for apolipoprotein B.

Besides, potentially other HDL protective actions may be affected with weight gain and these changes may occur even before the obesity range. 
Methods: Lipid profile, body mass index (BMI), biochemical measurements, and carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) were obtained in this cross-sectional study with 899 asymptomatic individuals. HDL functions were measured in a subgroup (n=101). 
Results: Individuals with increased HDL-C had an attenuated increase in cIMT with elevation of BMI. CEC, HDL-C, HDL size and HDL-antioxidant activity were negatively associated with cIMT. BMI was inversely associated with HDL-mediated inhibition of platelet aggregation and CEC, but surprisingly it was directly associated with the antioxidant activity. Thus, even in non-obese, non-diabetic individuals, increased BMI is associated with a wide change in protective functions of HDL, reducing CEC and increasing antioxidant activity. In these subjects, decreased HDL concentration, size or function are related to increased atherosclerotic burden.
Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate that in non-obese, non-diabetic individuals, the increasing values of BMI are associated with impaired protective functions of HDL and concomitant increase in atherosclerotic burden.",Downloaded successfully,/Volumes/Seagate_8TB/rxiv_072020/medrxiv.org/19002899v1.pdf,Jose Carlos de Lima-Junior; Vitor W Virginio; Filipe A Moura; Adriana Bertolami; Marcelo Bertolami; Otavio R Coelho-Filho; Ilaria Zanotti; Wilson Nadruz; Eliana Cotta Faria; Luiz S F Carvalho; Andrei C Sposito,,Jose Carlos de Lima-Junior,,Andrei C Sposito,,

Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of mortality in JSLE patients not attributable to disease flares. However, it is not possible to predict those patients at greatest risk using traditional CVR factors. METHODSerum metabolomic analysis was performed using a nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy-platform in 31 JSLE patients. Data was analysed using cluster, linear regression and receiver operating characteristic analysis. Results were validated in a second cohort of 31 JSLE patients and using data from a cohort of adult-onset SLE patients with known pre-clinical atherosclerotic plaque. RESULTS: Unbiased hierarchical clustering of metabolomic data identified three patient groups. Group-1 had decreased atheroprotective high density lipoproteins (HDL) and increased atherogenic very low and low density lipoproteins (VLDL/LDL); Group-2 had elevated HDL but reduced VLDL/LDL; and Group-3 had low HDL/VLDL/LDL levels. Notably, apolipoprotein(Apo)B1:ApoA1 ratio, a known CVR marker in adult cohorts, was elevated in Group-1 JSLE patients compared to Groups-2/3. The metabolomic signature was validated in a second JSLE cohort and compared with lipid biomarkers previously associated with pre-clinical atherosclerotic plaque in adult SLE patients. Linear regression analysis accounting for demographics, treatment, disease activity, lupus serological markers and body mass index confirmed that a unique metabolomic profile could differentiate between JSLE patients at high and low CVR. CONCLUSIONS: Patient stratification using ApoB:ApoA1 ratio and lipoprotein signatures could facilitate tailored lipid modification therapies and/or diet/lifestyle interventions to combat increased CVR in JSLE.",Downloaded successfully,/Volumes/Seagate_8TB/rxiv_072020/medrxiv.org/19000356v1.pdf,George A Robinson; Leda Coelewij; Ania Radziszewska; Chris Wincup; Hannah Peckham; Kirsty Waddington; David A Isenberg; Yiannis Ioannou; Coziana Ciurtin; Ines Pineda-Torra; Elizabeth C Jury,,George A Robinson,,Elizabeth C Jury,,
